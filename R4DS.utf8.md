# 前言 {-}
你好，这里是四川师范大学研究生公选课《数据科学中的R语言》的课程内容。考虑到大家来自不同的学院，有着不同的学科背景，因此讲授的内容不会太深奥（要有信心喔）。

比如在课程中以下内容就不会出现

$$
f(x)=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2 \pi}} e^{-\frac{1}{2} x^{2}}
$$

而出现更多的是


```r
library(tidyverse)
summary_monthly_temp <- weather %>% 
  group_by(month) %>% 
  summarize(mean = mean(temp), 
            std_dev = sd(temp))
```


在**跟进**本课程的同时， 我强烈推荐大家阅读Hadley Wickham的
[r4ds](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/)这本书 [@Wickham2017]。作者可是2019年8月刚刚获得考普斯总统奖（被誉为统计学的诺贝尔奖）的大神喔，点击[这里](http://hadley.nz/)可以看他照片。

# 数据科学与R语言 {#intro-ds}

马克思曾说过：“一门科学只有当它达到能够成功运用数学时，才算真正得到发展。”数学为数据科学提供了坚实的理论基础，数据科学也为**数学与实际应用**之间建立起一个直接的桥梁。


## 什么是数据科学

数据科学是综合了统计学、计算机科学和领域知识的交叉学科，其基本内容就是用数据的方法研究科学，用科学的方法研究数据（鄂维南院士）。2010年，Drew Conway画了一张数据科学的韦恩图

<img src="images/Data_Science2010.png" width="40%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

从数据科学所涉及的学科领域来看，其知识结构不仅仅包括数学、统计学、计算机科学、信息科学等在内的基础性理论，还应该包括社会学、物理学、情报学、生物医学等在内的专业性领域理论。

（事实上，最重要的最下面那个部分，专业领域的知识）

## 数据科学流程
Hadley Wickham将[数据科学流程](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/)分解成6个环节

<img src="images/data-science-explore.png" width="80%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />
即数据导入、数据规整、数据处理、可视化、建模以及形成可重复性报告，整个分析和探索过程都在一个程序代码中完成，这种方式对训练我们的数据思维非常有帮助。



## 为什么选择 R

2016年权威机构KDnuggets做过调研，显示数据科学领域最受欢迎的工具，是python和R两种语言

<img src="images/Languages02.jpg" width="60%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

事实上，python和R都是非常强大的工具，两者各有优劣，作为初学者，究竟选择谁?
可以参考[《为什么R语言是当今最值得学习的数据科学语言》](https://www.sharpsightlabs.com/blog/r-recommend-data-science/)，这篇文章做了详细的对比。我个人的观点是，如果想做程序员或者打算今后在工业企业里工作，可以选择python; 如果你今后打算在科研机构做学术研究，我推荐R语言作为入门语言。


2019 年国际统计学年会将考普斯总统奖（The Committee of Presidents of Statistical Societies
Awards，简称 COPSS 奖，被誉为统计学的诺贝尔奖）奖颁给 tidyverse的作者Hadley Wickham后，充分说明R语言得到了学术界的肯定和认可，我相信未来它在自然科学、社会科学和工业领域中的应用前景会非常光明。

* 数据科学为什么选择 R & tidyverse
  +  统计
  +  可视化
  +  探索性分析
  +  可重复性报告
  
* tidyverse
  + 语法一致性（学习一个宏包，可以帮助理解其他宏包）
  + 代码可读性，接近人类语言 ( `%>%` 太酷了 )



<!-- R 是一种为统计计算和绘图而生的语言和环境 -->

<!-- -  R 是一个全面的.hl[统计]研究平台 -->

<!-- - R 可运行于多种平台之上，包括Windows、UNIX 和 Mac OS X -->

<!-- - R 拥有顶尖水准的.hl[制图]功能 -->

<!-- - R 是免费的 -->

<!-- - R 应用广泛，拥有丰富的.hl[库包]  -->

<!-- - 活跃的社区 -->




## R vs Excel

为什么不能用excel做数据分析？画个图说明下

# R语言基础 {#intro-R}


R 软件是一个自由、开源软件平台，具有统计分析、可视化和编程的强大功能。
你可以从这里免费[下载](https://cloud.r-project.org)。 为了更好的使用 R 软件，我推荐大家使用 [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio)这个 IDE。这里有个[在线教程](https://www.rstudio.com/online-learning/)帮助我们熟悉 R 和 RStudio。



## 安装 R

我们从官方网站[http://cran.r-project.org](https://cloud.r-project.org)下载, 网站界面感觉有点朴素:


![](images/Rinstall.png)
 




## 安装 RStudio
安装完R， 还需要安装RStudio。有同学可能要问 R 与 RStudio 是什么关系呢？打个比方吧，R 就像汽车的发动机, RStudio 就是汽车的仪表盘。


<img src="images/engine.jpg" width="50%" /><img src="images/dashboard.jpg" width="50%" />



同样，我们从官方网站下载并安装，苹果系统的用户，选择苹果系统对应的rstudio版本即可。

- <https://www.rstudio.com/download>
- 选择`RStudio Desktop`

<img src="images/rstudio_install.png" width="85%" />


<div class="danger">
<p>这里有个小小的提示：</p>
<ul>
<li>电脑不要用中文用户名，否则Rstudio会杠上中文用户名</li>
<li>尽量安装在非系统盘，比如，可以选择安装在D盘</li>
<li>安装路径不要有中文和空格。比如，这样就比较好
<ul>
<li><code>D:/R</code></li>
<li><code>D:/Rstudio</code></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</div>





## 开始

安装完毕后，从windos`开始菜单`，点开`rstudio`图标，就打开了rstudio的窗口，界面效果如下

<img src="images/rstudio-editor.png" width="75%" />



RStudio 的用户界面十分友好，想要运行一段R代码，只需要在 RStudio 控制台面板最下面一行内键入R 代码，然后回车即可。比如我们键入`1 + 1` 并按回车后，RStudio 将显示如下结果

```r
1 + 1
```

```
## [1] 2
```



```r
log(8)
```

```
## [1] 2.079
```





```r
1:15
```

```
##  [1]  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15
```



## 对象


在R中存储的数据称为**对象**， R语言数据处理实际上就是不断的创建和操控这些对象。创建一个R对象，首先确定一个名称，然后使用
赋值操作符 `<-`，将数据赋值给它。比如，如果想给变量 x 赋值为5，在命令行中可以这样写 `x <- 5` ，然后回车.


```r
x <- 5
```



当键入`x` 然后回车，就打印出 x 的值。当然也可以使用命令`print(x)`，结果一样。

```r
x
```

```
## [1] 5
```




```r
x + 2
```

```
## [1] 7
```






```r
die <- 1:6
```



```r
die
```

```
## [1] 1 2 3 4 5 6
```



```r
die / 2
```

```
## [1] 0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0 2.5 3.0
```



```r
die * die
```

```
## [1]  1  4  9 16 25 36
```




```r
die %*% die
```

```
##      [,1]
## [1,]   91
```




```r
die %o% die
```

```
##      [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [,5] [,6]
## [1,]    1    2    3    4    5    6
## [2,]    2    4    6    8   10   12
## [3,]    3    6    9   12   15   18
## [4,]    4    8   12   16   20   24
## [5,]    5   10   15   20   25   30
## [6,]    6   12   18   24   30   36
```




## 数据结构

- 大家前面看到`x <- 1` 和 `x <- c(1, 2, 3)`，这就是最简单的数据对象，叫**原子型向量**。
- 用`c`函数将一组数据**构造**成向量


```r
die <- c(2, 4, 3, 1, 5, 7)
die
```

```
## [1] 2 4 3 1 5 7
```

长度为 1 的原子型向量

```r
x <- 1 # or
x <- c(1)
```


- 大家看到前面`die %o% die` 是**矩阵**类型，矩阵就是二维数组
- 可以用`matrix` 函数创建

```r
m <- matrix(c(2, 4, 3, 1, 5, 7),
  nrow = 2, ncol = 3, byrow = TRUE
)
```



```r
m
```

```
##      [,1] [,2] [,3]
## [1,]    2    4    3
## [2,]    1    5    7
```


- 数据对象：**数组**
- `array` 函数生成`n`维数组

```r
ar <- array(c(11:14, 21:24, 31:34), dim = c(2, 2, 3))
ar
```

```
## , , 1
## 
##      [,1] [,2]
## [1,]   11   13
## [2,]   12   14
## 
## , , 2
## 
##      [,1] [,2]
## [1,]   21   23
## [2,]   22   24
## 
## , , 3
## 
##      [,1] [,2]
## [1,]   31   33
## [2,]   32   34
```






- 数据对象：**列表**
- 与`c`函数创建向量的方式相似，不同的元素用逗号分开。不同的是，列表允许不同的数据类型（数值型，字符型，逻辑型等）， 而向量要求每个元素的数据类型必须相同。


```r
list1 <- list(100:110, "R", c(2, 4, 3, 1, 5, 7))
list1
```

```
## [[1]]
##  [1] 100 101 102 103 104 105 106 107 108 109 110
## 
## [[2]]
## [1] "R"
## 
## [[3]]
## [1] 2 4 3 1 5 7
```




- 数据对象：**数据框**
- `data.frame`函数构建


```r
df <- data.frame(
  name = c("ace", "bob", "carl", "kaite"),
  age = c(21, 14, 13, 15),
  sex = c("girl", "boy", "boy", "girl")
)
df
```

<div data-pagedtable="false">
  <script data-pagedtable-source type="application/json">
{"columns":[{"label":["name"],"name":[1],"type":["fctr"],"align":["left"]},{"label":["age"],"name":[2],"type":["dbl"],"align":["right"]},{"label":["sex"],"name":[3],"type":["fctr"],"align":["left"]}],"data":[{"1":"ace","2":"21","3":"girl"},{"1":"bob","2":"14","3":"boy"},{"1":"carl","2":"13","3":"boy"},{"1":"kaite","2":"15","3":"girl"}],"options":{"columns":{"min":{},"max":[10]},"rows":{"min":[10],"max":[10]},"pages":{}}}
  </script>
</div>






R 对象的数据结构(向量、矩阵、数组、列表和数据框)，总结如下

<img src="images/data_struction1.png" width="90%" />

为了更好地理解相关概念，建议大家阅读Garrett Grolemund的
[hopr](https://rstudio-education.github.io/hopr/)这本书 [@Garrett2014]。





## 函数

R 语言的强大在于使用**函数**操控各种对象，你可以把对象看作是名词，而函数看作是动词。
我们用一个简单的例子，`sum()`来演示函数如何工作的。这个函数的功能正如它的名字一样，对输入的各个对象求和，然后返回求和后的值，你可以在命令行中键入`?sum()`查看其官方文档。
`sum()`后的结果可以直接显示出来，也可以赋名。比如下面代码，首先计算`x + 10`并赋以名字`y`， 然后第二行中打印出来这个新创建的对象`y`


```r
y <- sum(x, 10)
y
```

```
## [1] 11
```

因为代码的灵活性，可以不断地重新定义对象。只要数据发生改变，原来的代码就会返回新的值。比如，对`x`重新赋值为 15， 同样运行`sum()`函数，这次我们不赋值给对象`y`，而是让它直接显示


```r
x <- 15
sum(x, 10)
```

```
## [1] 25
```

再比如

```r
round(3.14159)
```

```
## [1] 3
```




```r
mean(1:6)
```

```
## [1] 3.5
```




```r
n <- 100
x <- seq(1, n)
sum(x)
```

```
## [1] 5050
```




```r
dt <- mtcars[, 1:4]
head(dt)
```

<div data-pagedtable="false">
  <script data-pagedtable-source type="application/json">
{"columns":[{"label":[""],"name":["_rn_"],"type":[""],"align":["left"]},{"label":["mpg"],"name":[1],"type":["dbl"],"align":["right"]},{"label":["cyl"],"name":[2],"type":["dbl"],"align":["right"]},{"label":["disp"],"name":[3],"type":["dbl"],"align":["right"]},{"label":["hp"],"name":[4],"type":["dbl"],"align":["right"]}],"data":[{"1":"21.0","2":"6","3":"160","4":"110","_rn_":"Mazda RX4"},{"1":"21.0","2":"6","3":"160","4":"110","_rn_":"Mazda RX4 Wag"},{"1":"22.8","2":"4","3":"108","4":"93","_rn_":"Datsun 710"},{"1":"21.4","2":"6","3":"258","4":"110","_rn_":"Hornet 4 Drive"},{"1":"18.7","2":"8","3":"360","4":"175","_rn_":"Hornet Sportabout"},{"1":"18.1","2":"6","3":"225","4":"105","_rn_":"Valiant"}],"options":{"columns":{"min":{},"max":[10]},"rows":{"min":[10],"max":[10]},"pages":{}}}
  </script>
</div>



```r
cor(dt)
```

```
##          mpg     cyl    disp      hp
## mpg   1.0000 -0.8522 -0.8476 -0.7762
## cyl  -0.8522  1.0000  0.9020  0.8324
## disp -0.8476  0.9020  1.0000  0.7909
## hp   -0.7762  0.8324  0.7909  1.0000
```


## 脚本

如果我们已经写好了一段R程序，我们可以保存为**脚本**文件，脚本文件通常以.R作为文件的后缀名。比如我们可以将刚才创建`x`和 `y`对象的命令，保存为脚本文件`my_script.R`。
这样我们可以在其它时间修改和重新运行它。

在RStudio中，你可以通过菜单栏依此点击`File > New File > R Script` 来创建一个新的脚本。
强烈建议大家在运行代码之前，使用脚本的形式编写和编辑自己的程序，养成这样的习惯后，你今后所有的工作都有案可查，并且具有可重复性。

<img src="images/script1.png" width="75%" />




- 点击 `Run` 或者 `Source` 运行脚本

<img src="images/script2.png" width="75%" />




## 宏包

R 语言的强大还在于各种宏包，一般在[The Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN)](https://cran.r-project.org)下载安装。宏包扩展了R语言本身的各种功能，也为解决问题提供了各种方案。截至撰写本书时止，CRAN上大约有1.4万个宏包可以使用。但由于各种包接口不统一，语法不一致，也带来一些困扰。为了解决这个问题，RStudio 公司的[Hadley Wickham](http://hadley.nz) 与其带领的团队推出了`tidyverse`宏包， [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org)将常用的宏包整合在一起，并保持了语法的一致性。可以说，`tidyverse`宏包是R语言[入门](http://varianceexplained.org/r/teach-tidyverse/) 学习的首选。
本书正是基于`tidyverse`宏包而成的，本书也将通过一些例子不断地展示`tidyverse`在数据分析和可视化的应用。

可以用如下命令安装 `ggplot2` 宏包:


```r
# 安装单个包
install.packages("tidyverse")
```


```r
# 安装多个包
install.packages(c("ggplot2", "devtools", "dplyr"))
```








如果下载速度太慢，可以选择国内镜像
<img src="images/mirror1.png" width="75%" /><img src="images/mirror2.png" width="75%" />

如果安装宏包过程中出错，可以试试这样

```r
install.packages("tidyverse", repos = "http://cran.rstudio.com")
# 或者
install.packages("tidyverse", repos = "https://CRAN.R-project.org")
```

如果遇到如下报错信息

```r
Warning in install.packages :
  unable to access index for repository http://cran.rstudio.com/src/contrib:
  cannot open URL 'http://cran.rstudio.com/src/contrib/PACKAGES'
```

输入下面命令后，再试试

```r
options(download.file.method="libcurl")
```

或者打开`D:\R\etc\Rprofile.site`，添加以下内容：

```r
local({r <- getOption("repos")
       r["CRAN"] <- "http://mirrors.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/CRAN"
       options(repos=r)})

options(download.file.method="libcurl")
```


如果打开代码是乱码，可以试试修改如下设置

<img src="images/code_utf_8.png" width="75%" />



## 如何获取帮助


- 记住和学习所有的函数几乎是不可能的
- 打开函数的帮助页面(`Rstudio`右下面板的`Help`选项卡)


```r
?sqrt
?gather
?spread
?ggplot2
?scale
?map_dfr
```

比如：

<img src="images/Rhelp.png" width="90%" />

# 子集选取 {#subsetting}

子集选取单独作一章，说明它确实很重要。

## 向量


对于原子型向量，我们有至少四种方法取子集

```r
x <- c(1.1, 2.2, 3.3, 4.4, 5.5)
```


- 正整数： 指定向量元素中的位置

```r
x[1]
```

```
## [1] 1.1
```


```r
x[c(3,1)]
```

```
## [1] 3.3 1.1
```

- 负整数：删除指定位置的元素

```r
x[-2]
```

```
## [1] 1.1 3.3 4.4 5.5
```

- 逻辑向量：将`TRUE`对应位置的元素提取出来

```r
x[c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE, FALSE, TRUE)]
```

```
## [1] 1.1 3.3 5.5
```



- 如果是命名向量

```r
y <- c("a" =  11, "b" =  12, "c" =  13, "d" =  14)
y
```

```
##  a  b  c  d 
## 11 12 13 14
```

我们可以用名字向量，返回对应位置的向量

```r
y[c("d", "c", "a")]
```

```
##  d  c  a 
## 14 13 11
```

## 列表

对列表取子集，和向量的方法一样。使用`[`总是返回列表，`[[`和`$` 返回列表中的元素

```r
l <- list("one" = c("a", "b", "c"), 
		  "two" = c(1:5), 
		  "three" = c(TRUE, FALSE)
		  )
l
```

```
## $one
## [1] "a" "b" "c"
## 
## $two
## [1] 1 2 3 4 5
## 
## $three
## [1]  TRUE FALSE
```


```r
l[1]
```

```
## $one
## [1] "a" "b" "c"
```


```r
l[[1]]
```

```
## [1] "a" "b" "c"
```
也可以

```r
l[["one"]]
```

```
## [1] "a" "b" "c"
```
取出`one`位置上的元素，需要写`[["one"]]`， 程序员觉得太麻烦了，所以用`$`来简写

```r
l$one
```

```
## [1] "a" "b" "c"
```

所以请记住
- `[` 和`[[`的区别
-`x$y` 是 `x[["y"]]`的简写
 
 
## 矩阵


```r
a <- matrix(1:9, nrow = 3)
a
```

```
##      [,1] [,2] [,3]
## [1,]    1    4    7
## [2,]    2    5    8
## [3,]    3    6    9
```
我们取第1到2行的2-3列，`[1:2, 2:3]`，中间以逗号分隔，于是得到一个新的矩阵

```r
a[1:2, 2:3]
```

```
##      [,1] [,2]
## [1,]    4    7
## [2,]    5    8
```

默认情况下, `[` 会将获取的数据，以尽可能低的维度形式呈现。比如

```r
a[1, 1:2]
```

```
## [1] 1 4
```
表示第1行的第1、2列，此时不是$1 \times 2$矩阵，而是包含了两个元素的向量。
**以尽可能低的维度形式呈现**，换句话说，这个1, 4长的像个矩阵，又有点像向量，向量的维度比矩阵低，那就是向量吧。


有些时候，我们想保留所有的行或者列，比如这里我们选取1到2行的所有列，可以这样简写


```r
a[1:2, ]
```

```
##      [,1] [,2] [,3]
## [1,]    1    4    7
## [2,]    2    5    8
```

想想，会输出什么

```r
a[,]
```

```
##      [,1] [,2] [,3]
## [1,]    1    4    7
## [2,]    2    5    8
## [3,]    3    6    9
```
可以再简化点？

```r
a[]
```

```
##      [,1] [,2] [,3]
## [1,]    1    4    7
## [2,]    2    5    8
## [3,]    3    6    9
```

是不是可以再简化点？

```r
a
```

```
##      [,1] [,2] [,3]
## [1,]    1    4    7
## [2,]    2    5    8
## [3,]    3    6    9
```

## 数据框

数据框具有list和matrix的属性，因此

- 当选取数据框的某几列的时候，可以和list一样，指定元素位置，比如`df[1:2]`选取前两列 
- 也可以像矩阵一样，使用行和列的标识选取，比如`df[1:3, ]`选取前三行的所有列


```r
df <- data.frame(x = 1:4,
				 y = 4:1,
				 z = c("a", "b", "c", "d")
				 )
df
```

<div data-pagedtable="false">
  <script data-pagedtable-source type="application/json">
{"columns":[{"label":["x"],"name":[1],"type":["int"],"align":["right"]},{"label":["y"],"name":[2],"type":["int"],"align":["right"]},{"label":["z"],"name":[3],"type":["fctr"],"align":["left"]}],"data":[{"1":"1","2":"4","3":"a"},{"1":"2","2":"3","3":"b"},{"1":"3","2":"2","3":"c"},{"1":"4","2":"1","3":"d"}],"options":{"columns":{"min":{},"max":[10]},"rows":{"min":[10],"max":[10]},"pages":{}}}
  </script>
</div>

```r
# Like a list
df[c("x", "z")]
```

<div data-pagedtable="false">
  <script data-pagedtable-source type="application/json">
{"columns":[{"label":["x"],"name":[1],"type":["int"],"align":["right"]},{"label":["z"],"name":[2],"type":["fctr"],"align":["left"]}],"data":[{"1":"1","2":"a"},{"1":"2","2":"b"},{"1":"3","2":"c"},{"1":"4","2":"d"}],"options":{"columns":{"min":{},"max":[10]},"rows":{"min":[10],"max":[10]},"pages":{}}}
  </script>
</div>




```r
# Like a matrix
df[, c("x", "z")]
```

<div data-pagedtable="false">
  <script data-pagedtable-source type="application/json">
{"columns":[{"label":["x"],"name":[1],"type":["int"],"align":["right"]},{"label":["z"],"name":[2],"type":["fctr"],"align":["left"]}],"data":[{"1":"1","2":"a"},{"1":"2","2":"b"},{"1":"3","2":"c"},{"1":"4","2":"d"}],"options":{"columns":{"min":{},"max":[10]},"rows":{"min":[10],"max":[10]},"pages":{}}}
  </script>
</div>


也可以通过行和列的位置

```r
df[1:2]
```

<div data-pagedtable="false">
  <script data-pagedtable-source type="application/json">
{"columns":[{"label":["x"],"name":[1],"type":["int"],"align":["right"]},{"label":["y"],"name":[2],"type":["int"],"align":["right"]}],"data":[{"1":"1","2":"4"},{"1":"2","2":"3"},{"1":"3","2":"2"},{"1":"4","2":"1"}],"options":{"columns":{"min":{},"max":[10]},"rows":{"min":[10],"max":[10]},"pages":{}}}
  </script>
</div>



```r
df[1:3, ]
```

<div data-pagedtable="false">
  <script data-pagedtable-source type="application/json">
{"columns":[{"label":[""],"name":["_rn_"],"type":[""],"align":["left"]},{"label":["x"],"name":[1],"type":["int"],"align":["right"]},{"label":["y"],"name":[2],"type":["int"],"align":["right"]},{"label":["z"],"name":[3],"type":["fctr"],"align":["left"]}],"data":[{"1":"1","2":"4","3":"a","_rn_":"1"},{"1":"2","2":"3","3":"b","_rn_":"2"},{"1":"3","2":"2","3":"c","_rn_":"3"}],"options":{"columns":{"min":{},"max":[10]},"rows":{"min":[10],"max":[10]},"pages":{}}}
  </script>
</div>


也和矩阵一样，遇到单行单列的时候，数据会降维

```r
df[, "x"]
```

```
## [1] 1 2 3 4
```


如果不想避免降维，需要多写一句话

```r
df[, "x", drop = FALSE]
```

<div data-pagedtable="false">
  <script data-pagedtable-source type="application/json">
{"columns":[{"label":["x"],"name":[1],"type":["int"],"align":["right"]}],"data":[{"1":"1"},{"1":"2"},{"1":"3"},{"1":"4"}],"options":{"columns":{"min":{},"max":[10]},"rows":{"min":[10],"max":[10]},"pages":{}}}
  </script>
</div>
这样输出的还是矩阵形式, 但程序员总是偷懒的，有时候我们也容易忘记写`drop = FALSE`，
所以我比较喜欢下面的`tibble`.



## tibble

tibble是增强型的data.frame，选取tibble的行或者列，即使遇到单行或者单列的时候，数据也不会降维，总是返回tibble，即仍然是数据框的形式。


```r
tb <- tibble::tibble(
  x = 1:4,
  y = 4:1,
  z = c("a", "b", "c", "d")
)
tb
```

<div data-pagedtable="false">
  <script data-pagedtable-source type="application/json">
{"columns":[{"label":["x"],"name":[1],"type":["int"],"align":["right"]},{"label":["y"],"name":[2],"type":["int"],"align":["right"]},{"label":["z"],"name":[3],"type":["chr"],"align":["left"]}],"data":[{"1":"1","2":"4","3":"a"},{"1":"2","2":"3","3":"b"},{"1":"3","2":"2","3":"c"},{"1":"4","2":"1","3":"d"}],"options":{"columns":{"min":{},"max":[10]},"rows":{"min":[10],"max":[10]},"pages":{}}}
  </script>
</div>



```r
tb["x"]
```

<div data-pagedtable="false">
  <script data-pagedtable-source type="application/json">
{"columns":[{"label":["x"],"name":[1],"type":["int"],"align":["right"]}],"data":[{"1":"1"},{"1":"2"},{"1":"3"},{"1":"4"}],"options":{"columns":{"min":{},"max":[10]},"rows":{"min":[10],"max":[10]},"pages":{}}}
  </script>
</div>



```r
tb[, "x"]
```

<div data-pagedtable="false">
  <script data-pagedtable-source type="application/json">
{"columns":[{"label":["x"],"name":[1],"type":["int"],"align":["right"]}],"data":[{"1":"1"},{"1":"2"},{"1":"3"},{"1":"4"}],"options":{"columns":{"min":{},"max":[10]},"rows":{"min":[10],"max":[10]},"pages":{}}}
  </script>
</div>
除此以外，`tibble`还有很多优良的[特性](https://tibble.tidyverse.org/)。

# 数据可视化 {#visual}

上节课介绍了R语言的基本数据结构，可能大家有种看美剧的感觉，有些懵。这很正常，我在开始学习R的时候，感觉和大家一样，所以不要惊慌，我们后面会慢慢填补这些知识点。

这节课，我们介绍R语言最强大的可视化，看看都有哪些炫酷的操作。




```r
library(tidyverse)
library(patchwork)
```


## 为什么要可视化
我们先从一个故事开始，1854年伦敦爆发严重霍乱，当时流行的观点是霍乱是通过空气传播的，而John Snow医生（不是《权力的游戏》里的 Jon Snow）研究发现，霍乱是通过饮用水传播的。研究过程中，John Snow医生统计每户病亡人数，每死亡一人标注一条横线，分析发现，大多数病例的住所都围绕在Broad Street水泵附近，结合其他证据得出饮用水传播的结论，于是移掉了Broad Street水泵的把手，霍乱最终得到控制。



<img src="images/Cholera1.png" width="50%" /><img src="images/Cholera2.png" width="50%" />


另一个有趣的例子就是辛普森悖论（Simpson's Paradox）。比如我们想研究下，学习时间和考试成绩的关联。结果发现两者呈负相关性，即补课时间越长，考试成绩反而越差（下图横坐标是学习时间，纵坐标是考试成绩），很明显这个结果有违生活常识。

<img src="R4DS_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-83-1.png" width="576" /><img src="R4DS_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-83-2.png" width="576" />

事实上，当我们把学生按照不同年级分成五组，再来观察学习时间和考试成绩之间的关联，发现相关性完全逆转了! 我们可以看到学习时间和考试成绩强烈正相关。


辛普森悖论在日常生活中层出不穷。 那么如何避免辛普森悖论呢？我们能做的，就是仔细地研究分析各种影响因素，不要笼统概括地、浅尝辄止地看问题。其中，可视化分析为我们提供了一个好的方法。

## ggplot2 的图形语法

ggplot2是R语言最流行的宏包，是RStudio首席科学家Hadley Wickham读博期间的作品，是R相比其他语言一个独领风骚的特点。包名中“gg”是grammar of graphics的简称，是一套优雅的绘图语法。
ggplot的语法包括9个部件：

- **数据 (data)**
- **映射 (mapping)**
- **几何对象 (geom)**
- 统计变换 (stats)
- 标度 (scale)
- 坐标系 (coord)
- 分面 (facet)
- 主题 (theme)
- 存储和输出 (output)

其中前三个是必需的。Hadley Wickham将这套语法诠释为，一张统计图形就是从数据到几何对象（geometric object，缩写geom）的图形属性（aesthetic attribute，缩写aes）的一个映射。此外，图形中还可能包含数据的统计变换（statistical transformation，缩写stats），最后绘制在某个特定的坐标系（coordinate system，缩写coord）中，而分面（facet）则可以用来生成数据不同子集的图形。



我们用ggplot2宏包内置的汽车测试数据（mpg）来演示，我们用到了四个变量


```r
mpg %>% select(displ, hwy, cyl, class)
```

<div data-pagedtable="false">

- displ： 发动机排量
- hwy： 每加仑英里数
- cyl：汽缸数目
- class：汽车类型

最简单的例子开始，绘制displ和hwy的散点图，

```r
ggplot(data = mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + 
  geom_point()
```

- `ggplot()`表示调用该函数画图，`data = mpg` 表示使用mpg数据框来画图。
- `aes()`表示数据和视觉属性之间的映射，通俗来讲，不同的数值，转换成不同的位置、色彩或透明度等。

`aes(x = displ, y = hwy)`，意思是变量displ作为（映射为）x轴方向的**位置**，变量hwy作为（映射为）y轴方向的**位置**。
- `+`表示添加图层。
- `geom_point()`表示绘制散点图。


运行脚本后生成图片：

<img src="R4DS_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-86-1.png" width="576" />

刚才看到的是位置上的映射，ggplot还包含了颜色、形状以及透明度等图形属性的映射，可以来比较不同分组，比如我们在`aes()`里增加一个`color = class`

```r
ggplot(data = mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = class)) + 
  geom_point()
```

<img src="R4DS_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-87-1.png" width="576" />

此图绘制了displ和hwy的散点图， 其中不同的汽车类型，用不同的颜色显示。

大家试试下面代码呢，

```r
ggplot(data = mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy, size = class)) + 
  geom_point()

ggplot(data = mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy, shape = class)) + 
  geom_point()

ggplot(data = mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy, aphha = class)) + 
  geom_point()
```



## 映射 vs.设置

想把图中的点指定为某一种颜色，可以使用设置语句，比如


```r
ggplot(mpg, aes(displ, hwy)) + geom_point(color = "blue")
```

<img src="R4DS_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-89-1.png" width="576" />

大家也可以试试下面

```r
ggplot(mpg, aes(displ, hwy)) + geom_point(size = 5)
ggplot(mpg, aes(displ, hwy)) + geom_point(shape = 3)
ggplot(mpg, aes(displ, hwy)) + geom_point(alpha = 0.5)
```


思考下`aes(color = "blue")`为什么会红色的点？

```r
ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = "blue")) + 
  geom_point()
```

<img src="R4DS_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-91-1.png" width="576" />




## 几何对象

`geom_point()` 可以画散点图，也可以使用`geom_smooth()`绘制平滑曲线，

```r
p1 <- ggplot(data = mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + 
  geom_point()

p2 <- ggplot(data = mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + 
  geom_smooth()

p3 <- ggplot(data = mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + 
   geom_point() +
   geom_smooth()

p1 + p2 + p3
```

<img src="R4DS_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-92-1.png" width="576" />




## Global vs. Local


```r
ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = class)) + 
  geom_point()
```

<img src="R4DS_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-93-1.png" width="576" />



```r
ggplot(mpg) + 
  geom_point( aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = class))
```

<img src="R4DS_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-94-1.png" width="576" />

大家可以看到，以上两段代码出来的图是一样。




事实上，如果映射关系`aes()` 写在`ggplot()`里, 


```r
ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = class)) + 
  geom_point()
```
`x = displ, y = hwy, color = class` 为全局变量。如果映射关系`aes()` 写在几何对象`geom_point()`里, 就为局部变量, 比如。

```r
ggplot(mpg) + 
  geom_point(aes(displ, hwy, color = class))
```


如果`geom_point()`中缺少所绘图所需要的映射关系，就会继承全局变量的映射关系`aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = class)` 。

```r
ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = class)) + 
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth()
```
这里的 `geom_point()` 和 `geom_smooth()` 都会从全局变量中继承映射关系。如果局部变量中的映射关系已经存在，那么就不会从全局变量中继承，沿用当前的映射关系。


```r
ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = class)) + 
  geom_point(aes(color = factor(cyl))) 
```

<img src="R4DS_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-98-1.png" width="576" />


大家细细体会下，下面两段代码的区别

```r
ggplot(mpg, aes(displ, hwy, color = class)) + 
  geom_smooth(method = lm) +
  geom_point()
```

<img src="R4DS_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-99-1.png" width="576" />



```r
ggplot(mpg, aes(displ, hwy)) + 
  geom_smooth(method = lm) +
  geom_point(aes(color = class))
```

<img src="R4DS_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-100-1.png" width="576" />




## saving plots

可以使用ggsave()函数，将图片保存为所需要的格式，如".pdf", ".png"等


```r
ggsave("myfirst_plot.pdf", width = 6, height = 6, dpi = 300)
```

## Communicating with Data via R Markdown

*Instructions*

1. 安装最新版本 [R](https://cran.r-project.org/mirrors.html) (>3.5) 和 [RStudio Desktop](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/) (>1.2).
2. 安装 [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/get/). 然而这个软件会比较大
   (e.g. MacTeX is approximate 3.9G). 如果你之前没有安装过
   LaTeX，我推荐你安装轻量级的 `tinytex`. 安装方法如下，打开R，然后再命令行输入:


```r
install.packages("tinytex")
tinytex::install_tinytex()
```

3. 安装如下宏包:

```r
install.packages(c("tidyverse", 
                 "rmarkdown", 
                 "knitr",
                 "xaringan", 
                 "usethis",
                 "rmdformats", 
                 "prettydoc",
                 "rticles",
                 "linl",
                 "shiny",
                 "bookdown",
                 "pagedown",
                 "remotes"))

# 数据处理 {#dplyr}

Hadley Wickhamt提出了数据科学tidy原则，我结合自己的理解，tidy思想体现在:

- 一切都是数据框，任何数据都可以规整
- 数据框的一列代表一个**变量**，数据框的一行代表一次**观察**
- 函数处理数据时，数据框进数据框出


本章我们介绍tidyverse里数据处理的神器dplyr宏包。首先，我们加载该宏包

```r
library(dplyr)
```



dplyr 定义了数据处理的规范语法，其中主要包含以下七个主要的函数。



* `mutate() `, `select() `, `filter() ` 
* `summarise() `, `group_by()`, `arrange() `
* `left_join()`, `right_join()`， `full_join()`

我们依次介绍

## `mutate() `

假定我们有一数据框，包含三位学生的英语和数学


```r
df <- tibble(
      name = c("Alice", "Alice", "Bob", "Bob", "Carol", "Carol"),
      type = c("english", "math", "english", "math", "english", "math")
)

df
```

<div data-pagedtable="false">
  <script data-pagedtable-source type="application/json">
{"columns":[{"label":["name"],"name":[1],"type":["chr"],"align":["left"]},{"label":["type"],"name":[2],"type":["chr"],"align":["left"]}],"data":[{"1":"Alice","2":"english"},{"1":"Alice","2":"math"},{"1":"Bob","2":"english"},{"1":"Bob","2":"math"},{"1":"Carol","2":"english"},{"1":"Carol","2":"math"}],"options":{"columns":{"min":{},"max":[10]},"rows":{"min":[10],"max":[10]},"pages":{}}}
  </script>
</div>

这里有他们的考试成绩， 我们想增加到数据框里去

```r
s <- c(80.2, 90.5, 92.2, 90.8, 82.5, 84.6)
s 
```

```
## [1] 80.2 90.5 92.2 90.8 82.5 84.6
```
语法这样写

```r
mutate(df, score = s)
```

<div data-pagedtable="false">
  <script data-pagedtable-source type="application/json">
{"columns":[{"label":["name"],"name":[1],"type":["chr"],"align":["left"]},{"label":["type"],"name":[2],"type":["chr"],"align":["left"]},{"label":["score"],"name":[3],"type":["dbl"],"align":["right"]}],"data":[{"1":"Alice","2":"english","3":"80.2"},{"1":"Alice","2":"math","3":"90.5"},{"1":"Bob","2":"english","3":"92.2"},{"1":"Bob","2":"math","3":"90.8"},{"1":"Carol","2":"english","3":"82.5"},{"1":"Carol","2":"math","3":"84.6"}],"options":{"columns":{"min":{},"max":[10]},"rows":{"min":[10],"max":[10]},"pages":{}}}
  </script>
</div>

`mutate()` 函数第一参数是我们要处理的数据框，比如这里的`df`，紧跟着的是`score = s`，等号左边的`score`是我们打算创建一个新列，而取的列名；等号右边是装着学生成绩的向量（注意，向量 的长度要与数据框的行数相等，比如这里长度都是6）

## `管道` %>%

这里有必要介绍下管道操作符 `%>%` .



```r
sum(c(1:10))
```

```
## [1] 55
```
与下面的写法是等价的,

```r
c(1:10) %>% sum()
```

```
## [1] 55
```
这条语句的意思，向量`c(1:10)` 通过管道操作符 `%>%` ，传递到函数`sum()`的第一个参数位置，即`sum(c(1:10))`， 这个`%>%`管道操作符还是很形象的， 且对执行多个函数操作的时候，就显得格外方便，代码可读性更强。

```r
# sqrt(sum(abs(c(-10:10)))) 
c(-10:10) %>% abs() %>% sum() %>% sqrt()
```

```
## [1] 10.49
```


那么，上面增加学生成绩的语句`mutate(df, score = s)`就可以写为


```r
# 等价于
df %>% mutate(score = s)
```

<div data-pagedtable="false">
  <script data-pagedtable-source type="application/json">
{"columns":[{"label":["name"],"name":[1],"type":["chr"],"align":["left"]},{"label":["type"],"name":[2],"type":["chr"],"align":["left"]},{"label":["score"],"name":[3],"type":["dbl"],"align":["right"]}],"data":[{"1":"Alice","2":"english","3":"80.2"},{"1":"Alice","2":"math","3":"90.5"},{"1":"Bob","2":"english","3":"92.2"},{"1":"Bob","2":"math","3":"90.8"},{"1":"Carol","2":"english","3":"82.5"},{"1":"Carol","2":"math","3":"84.6"}],"options":{"columns":{"min":{},"max":[10]},"rows":{"min":[10],"max":[10]},"pages":{}}}
  </script>
</div>
是不是很赞？


## `select() `

`select() `顾名思义`选择`，就是选择数据框的某一列，我们还是以学生成绩的数据框为例

```r
df <- df %>% mutate(score = s)
df
```

<div data-pagedtable="false">
  <script data-pagedtable-source type="application/json">
{"columns":[{"label":["name"],"name":[1],"type":["chr"],"align":["left"]},{"label":["type"],"name":[2],"type":["chr"],"align":["left"]},{"label":["score"],"name":[3],"type":["dbl"],"align":["right"]}],"data":[{"1":"Alice","2":"english","3":"80.2"},{"1":"Alice","2":"math","3":"90.5"},{"1":"Bob","2":"english","3":"92.2"},{"1":"Bob","2":"math","3":"90.8"},{"1":"Carol","2":"english","3":"82.5"},{"1":"Carol","2":"math","3":"84.6"}],"options":{"columns":{"min":{},"max":[10]},"rows":{"min":[10],"max":[10]},"pages":{}}}
  </script>
</div>

我们可以选择`name`列, 结果是只有一列的数据框（仍然数据框喔）

```r
df %>% select(name)
```

<div data-pagedtable="false">
  <script data-pagedtable-source type="application/json">
{"columns":[{"label":["name"],"name":[1],"type":["chr"],"align":["left"]}],"data":[{"1":"Alice"},{"1":"Alice"},{"1":"Bob"},{"1":"Bob"},{"1":"Carol"},{"1":"Carol"}],"options":{"columns":{"min":{},"max":[10]},"rows":{"min":[10],"max":[10]},"pages":{}}}
  </script>
</div>


如果选取多列，就再写一个就行了

```r
df %>% select(name, score)
```

<div data-pagedtable="false">
  <script data-pagedtable-source type="application/json">
{"columns":[{"label":["name"],"name":[1],"type":["chr"],"align":["left"]},{"label":["score"],"name":[2],"type":["dbl"],"align":["right"]}],"data":[{"1":"Alice","2":"80.2"},{"1":"Alice","2":"90.5"},{"1":"Bob","2":"92.2"},{"1":"Bob","2":"90.8"},{"1":"Carol","2":"82.5"},{"1":"Carol","2":"84.6"}],"options":{"columns":{"min":{},"max":[10]},"rows":{"min":[10],"max":[10]},"pages":{}}}
  </script>
</div>
如果不想要某列， 可以在变量前面加`-`， 结果与上面的一样


```r
df %>% select(-type)
```

<div data-pagedtable="false">
  <script data-pagedtable-source type="application/json">
{"columns":[{"label":["name"],"name":[1],"type":["chr"],"align":["left"]},{"label":["score"],"name":[2],"type":["dbl"],"align":["right"]}],"data":[{"1":"Alice","2":"80.2"},{"1":"Alice","2":"90.5"},{"1":"Bob","2":"92.2"},{"1":"Bob","2":"90.8"},{"1":"Carol","2":"82.5"},{"1":"Carol","2":"84.6"}],"options":{"columns":{"min":{},"max":[10]},"rows":{"min":[10],"max":[10]},"pages":{}}}
  </script>
</div>


## `filter() `

`select`是列方向的选择， 我们还可以对数据行方向的选择和筛选，比如这里把**成绩高于90分的**同学筛选出来


```r
df %>% filter(score >= 90)
```

<div data-pagedtable="false">
  <script data-pagedtable-source type="application/json">
{"columns":[{"label":["name"],"name":[1],"type":["chr"],"align":["left"]},{"label":["type"],"name":[2],"type":["chr"],"align":["left"]},{"label":["score"],"name":[3],"type":["dbl"],"align":["right"]}],"data":[{"1":"Alice","2":"math","3":"90.5"},{"1":"Bob","2":"english","3":"92.2"},{"1":"Bob","2":"math","3":"90.8"}],"options":{"columns":{"min":{},"max":[10]},"rows":{"min":[10],"max":[10]},"pages":{}}}
  </script>
</div>

也可以限定多个条件进行筛选, 英语成绩高于90分的筛选出来

```r
df %>% filter(type == "english", score >= 90)
```

<div data-pagedtable="false">
  <script data-pagedtable-source type="application/json">
{"columns":[{"label":["name"],"name":[1],"type":["chr"],"align":["left"]},{"label":["type"],"name":[2],"type":["chr"],"align":["left"]},{"label":["score"],"name":[3],"type":["dbl"],"align":["right"]}],"data":[{"1":"Bob","2":"english","3":"92.2"}],"options":{"columns":{"min":{},"max":[10]},"rows":{"min":[10],"max":[10]},"pages":{}}}
  </script>
</div>

## `summarise() `统计

`summarise() `主要用于统计，往往与其他函数配合使用，比如计算所有同学的考试成绩的均值

```r
df %>% summarise( mean_score = mean(score))
```

<div data-pagedtable="false">
  <script data-pagedtable-source type="application/json">
{"columns":[{"label":["mean_score"],"name":[1],"type":["dbl"],"align":["right"]}],"data":[{"1":"86.8"}],"options":{"columns":{"min":{},"max":[10]},"rows":{"min":[10],"max":[10]},"pages":{}}}
  </script>
</div>
还同时完成多个统计

```r
df %>% summarise( mean_score = mean(score),
                  median_score = median(score)
                  )
```

<div data-pagedtable="false">
  <script data-pagedtable-source type="application/json">
{"columns":[{"label":["mean_score"],"name":[1],"type":["dbl"],"align":["right"]},{"label":["median_score"],"name":[2],"type":["dbl"],"align":["right"]}],"data":[{"1":"86.8","2":"87.55"}],"options":{"columns":{"min":{},"max":[10]},"rows":{"min":[10],"max":[10]},"pages":{}}}
  </script>
</div>


## `group_by()`分组

事实上，`summarise() `往往配合`group_by()`一起使用，即，先分组再统计。比如，我们想统计每个学生的平均成绩，那么就需要先按学生`name`分组，然后求平均

```r
df %>% 
  group_by(name) %>% 
  summarise( mean_score = mean(score)  )
```

<div data-pagedtable="false">
  <script data-pagedtable-source type="application/json">
{"columns":[{"label":["name"],"name":[1],"type":["chr"],"align":["left"]},{"label":["mean_score"],"name":[2],"type":["dbl"],"align":["right"]}],"data":[{"1":"Alice","2":"85.35"},{"1":"Bob","2":"91.50"},{"1":"Carol","2":"83.55"}],"options":{"columns":{"min":{},"max":[10]},"rows":{"min":[10],"max":[10]},"pages":{}}}
  </script>
</div>

## `arrange() `排序
这个很好理解的。比如我们按照考试成绩从低到高排序，然后输出

```r
df %>% arrange(score)
```

<div data-pagedtable="false">
  <script data-pagedtable-source type="application/json">
{"columns":[{"label":["name"],"name":[1],"type":["chr"],"align":["left"]},{"label":["type"],"name":[2],"type":["chr"],"align":["left"]},{"label":["score"],"name":[3],"type":["dbl"],"align":["right"]}],"data":[{"1":"Alice","2":"english","3":"80.2"},{"1":"Carol","2":"english","3":"82.5"},{"1":"Carol","2":"math","3":"84.6"},{"1":"Alice","2":"math","3":"90.5"},{"1":"Bob","2":"math","3":"90.8"},{"1":"Bob","2":"english","3":"92.2"}],"options":{"columns":{"min":{},"max":[10]},"rows":{"min":[10],"max":[10]},"pages":{}}}
  </script>
</div>
如果从高到低排序呢，有两种方法:

```r
df %>% arrange(-score)
```

<div data-pagedtable="false">
  <script data-pagedtable-source type="application/json">
{"columns":[{"label":["name"],"name":[1],"type":["chr"],"align":["left"]},{"label":["type"],"name":[2],"type":["chr"],"align":["left"]},{"label":["score"],"name":[3],"type":["dbl"],"align":["right"]}],"data":[{"1":"Bob","2":"english","3":"92.2"},{"1":"Bob","2":"math","3":"90.8"},{"1":"Alice","2":"math","3":"90.5"},{"1":"Carol","2":"math","3":"84.6"},{"1":"Carol","2":"english","3":"82.5"},{"1":"Alice","2":"english","3":"80.2"}],"options":{"columns":{"min":{},"max":[10]},"rows":{"min":[10],"max":[10]},"pages":{}}}
  </script>
</div>

写成下面这种形式也是降序排列，但可读性更强些

```r
df %>% arrange(desc(score))
```

<div data-pagedtable="false">
  <script data-pagedtable-source type="application/json">
{"columns":[{"label":["name"],"name":[1],"type":["chr"],"align":["left"]},{"label":["type"],"name":[2],"type":["chr"],"align":["left"]},{"label":["score"],"name":[3],"type":["dbl"],"align":["right"]}],"data":[{"1":"Bob","2":"english","3":"92.2"},{"1":"Bob","2":"math","3":"90.8"},{"1":"Alice","2":"math","3":"90.5"},{"1":"Carol","2":"math","3":"84.6"},{"1":"Carol","2":"english","3":"82.5"},{"1":"Alice","2":"english","3":"80.2"}],"options":{"columns":{"min":{},"max":[10]},"rows":{"min":[10],"max":[10]},"pages":{}}}
  </script>
</div>


也可对多个变量先后排序。先按学科排，然后按照成绩从高到底排序

```r
df %>% 
  arrange(type, -score)
```

<div data-pagedtable="false">
  <script data-pagedtable-source type="application/json">
{"columns":[{"label":["name"],"name":[1],"type":["chr"],"align":["left"]},{"label":["type"],"name":[2],"type":["chr"],"align":["left"]},{"label":["score"],"name":[3],"type":["dbl"],"align":["right"]}],"data":[{"1":"Bob","2":"english","3":"92.2"},{"1":"Carol","2":"english","3":"82.5"},{"1":"Alice","2":"english","3":"80.2"},{"1":"Bob","2":"math","3":"90.8"},{"1":"Alice","2":"math","3":"90.5"},{"1":"Carol","2":"math","3":"84.6"}],"options":{"columns":{"min":{},"max":[10]},"rows":{"min":[10],"max":[10]},"pages":{}}}
  </script>
</div>


## `left_join`
数据框合并，假定我们已经统计了每个同学的平均成绩，存放在`df1`


```r
df1 <- df %>% 
  group_by(name) %>% 
  summarise( mean_score = mean(score) )

df1
```

<div data-pagedtable="false">
  <script data-pagedtable-source type="application/json">
{"columns":[{"label":["name"],"name":[1],"type":["chr"],"align":["left"]},{"label":["mean_score"],"name":[2],"type":["dbl"],"align":["right"]}],"data":[{"1":"Alice","2":"85.35"},{"1":"Bob","2":"91.50"},{"1":"Carol","2":"83.55"}],"options":{"columns":{"min":{},"max":[10]},"rows":{"min":[10],"max":[10]},"pages":{}}}
  </script>
</div>

我们有新一个数据框`df2`，包含同学们的年龄信息

```r
df2 <- tibble(
      name = c("Alice", "Bob"),
      age =  c(12, 13)
)

df2
```

<div data-pagedtable="false">
  <script data-pagedtable-source type="application/json">
{"columns":[{"label":["name"],"name":[1],"type":["chr"],"align":["left"]},{"label":["age"],"name":[2],"type":["dbl"],"align":["right"]}],"data":[{"1":"Alice","2":"12"},{"1":"Bob","2":"13"}],"options":{"columns":{"min":{},"max":[10]},"rows":{"min":[10],"max":[10]},"pages":{}}}
  </script>
</div>

可以用 `left_join`把两个数据框`df1`和`df2`，合并连接再一起, 两个数据框是通过姓名`name`连接的，因此需要指定`by = "name"`


```r
df1 %>% left_join(df2, by = "name")
```

<div data-pagedtable="false">
  <script data-pagedtable-source type="application/json">
{"columns":[{"label":["name"],"name":[1],"type":["chr"],"align":["left"]},{"label":["mean_score"],"name":[2],"type":["dbl"],"align":["right"]},{"label":["age"],"name":[3],"type":["dbl"],"align":["right"]}],"data":[{"1":"Alice","2":"85.35","3":"12"},{"1":"Bob","2":"91.50","3":"13"},{"1":"Carol","2":"83.55","3":"NA"}],"options":{"columns":{"min":{},"max":[10]},"rows":{"min":[10],"max":[10]},"pages":{}}}
  </script>
</div>

大家注意到最后一行Carol的年龄是`NA`， 大家想想为什么呢？

我们再试试`right_join()`


```r
df1 %>% right_join(df2, by = "name")
```

<div data-pagedtable="false">
  <script data-pagedtable-source type="application/json">
{"columns":[{"label":["name"],"name":[1],"type":["chr"],"align":["left"]},{"label":["mean_score"],"name":[2],"type":["dbl"],"align":["right"]},{"label":["age"],"name":[3],"type":["dbl"],"align":["right"]}],"data":[{"1":"Alice","2":"85.35","3":"12"},{"1":"Bob","2":"91.50","3":"13"}],"options":{"columns":{"min":{},"max":[10]},"rows":{"min":[10],"max":[10]},"pages":{}}}
  </script>
</div>
Carol同学的信息没有了？ 大家想想又为什么呢？


事实上，答案就在函数的名字上，`left_join()`是左合并，即以左边数据框`df1`中的学生姓名`name`为准，在右边数据框`df2`里，有`Alice`和`Bob`的年龄，那么就对应合并过来，没有`Carol`，就为缺失值`NA`

`left_join()`是右合并，即以右边数据框`df2`中的学生姓名`name`为准，只有`Alice`和`Bob`，因此而`df1`只需要把`Alice`和`Bob`的信息粘过来。

# 正则表达式 {#stringr}



```r
library(tidyverse)
library(stringr)
```


## 什么是正则表达式

我们在word文档或者excel中，经常使用查找和替换, 然而有些情况，word是解决不了的，比如

- 条件搜索
  - 统计文中，前面有 “data”, “computer” or “statistical” 的 “analysis”，这个单词的个数
  - 找出文中重复的单词，比如“we love love you”
- 拼写检查
  - 电话号码（邮件，密码等）是否正确格式
  - 日期书写的规范与统一
- 提取信息
  - 提取文本特定位置的数据 
- 文本挖掘
  - 非结构化的提取成结构化


这个时候就需要用到正则表达式（Regular Expression），这一强大、便捷、高效的文本处理工具。那么，什么是正则表达式呢？简单点说，正则表达式是处理字符串的。复杂点说，正则表达式描述了一种字符串匹配的模式（pattern），通常被用来检索、替换那些符合某个模式(规则)的文本。这种固定的格式的文本，生活中常见的有电话号码、网络地址、邮件地址和日期格式等等。

正则表达式并不是R语言特有的，事实上，几乎所有程序语言都支持正则表达式。

R语言中的字符串操作，基础包里有很多函数可以使用，然而大神Hadley Wickham开发的stringr包让正则表达式简单易懂，所以今天我们介绍这个包，本章的内容与《R for data science》第10章基本一致。本章目的教大家写**简单的**正则表示式就行了。




## 字符串基础


### 字符串长度

想获取字符串的长度，可以使用`str_length()`函数

```r
str_length("R for data science")
```

```
## [1] 18
```

对字符串向量

```r
str_length(c("a", "R for data science", NA))
```

```
## [1]  1 18 NA
```

数据框里配合dplyr函数，同样很方便

```r
data.frame(
  x = c("a", "R for data science", NA)
  ) %>%
  mutate(y = str_length(x))
```

<div data-pagedtable="false">
  <script data-pagedtable-source type="application/json">
{"columns":[{"label":["x"],"name":[1],"type":["fctr"],"align":["left"]},{"label":["y"],"name":[2],"type":["int"],"align":["right"]}],"data":[{"1":"a","2":"1"},{"1":"R for data science","2":"18"},{"1":"NA","2":"NA"}],"options":{"columns":{"min":{},"max":[10]},"rows":{"min":[10],"max":[10]},"pages":{}}}
  </script>
</div>







### 字符串组合


把字符串拼接在一起

```r
str_c("x", "y")
```

```
## [1] "xy"
```


把字符串拼接在一起，可以设置中间的间隔

```r
str_c("x", "y", sep = ", ")
```

```
## [1] "x, y"
```



```r
str_c(c("x", "y", "z"), sep = ", ")
```

```
## [1] "x" "y" "z"
```
是不是和你想象的不一样，那就`?str_c`，或者试试这个


```r
str_c(c("x", "y", "z"), c("x", "y", "z"), sep = ", ")
```

```
## [1] "x, x" "y, y" "z, z"
```

用在数据框里

```r
data.frame(
  x = c("I", "love", "you"),
  y = c("you", "like", "me")
  ) %>%
  mutate(z = str_c(x, y, sep = "|"))
```

<div data-pagedtable="false">
  <script data-pagedtable-source type="application/json">
{"columns":[{"label":["x"],"name":[1],"type":["fctr"],"align":["left"]},{"label":["y"],"name":[2],"type":["fctr"],"align":["left"]},{"label":["z"],"name":[3],"type":["chr"],"align":["left"]}],"data":[{"1":"I","2":"you","3":"I|you"},{"1":"love","2":"like","3":"love|like"},{"1":"you","2":"me","3":"you|me"}],"options":{"columns":{"min":{},"max":[10]},"rows":{"min":[10],"max":[10]},"pages":{}}}
  </script>
</div>

使用collapse选项，是先组合，然后再转换成单个字符串，大家对比下


```r
str_c(c("x", "y", "z"), c("a", "b", "c"), sep = "|")
```

```
## [1] "x|a" "y|b" "z|c"
```


```r
str_c(c("x", "y", "z"), c("a", "b", "c"), collapse = "|")
```

```
## [1] "xa|yb|zc"
```







### 字符串取子集

截取字符串的一部分，需要指定截取的开始位置和结束位置

```r
x <- c("Apple", "Banana", "Pear")
str_sub(x, 1, 3)
```

```
## [1] "App" "Ban" "Pea"
```

开始位置和结束位置如果是负整数，就表示位置是从后往前数，比如下面这段代码，截取倒数第3个至倒数第1个位置上的字符串

```r
x <- c("Apple", "Banana", "Pear")
str_sub(x, -3, -1)
```

```
## [1] "ple" "ana" "ear"
```


也可以进行赋值，如果该位置上有字符，就用新的字符替换旧的字符

```r
str_sub(x, 1, 1) <- "Q"
x
```

```
## [1] "Qpple"  "Qanana" "Qear"
```






## 使用正则表达式进行模式匹配

正则表示式慢慢会呈现了

### 基础匹配

`str_view()` 是查看string是否匹配pattern，如果匹配，就高亮显示

```r
x <- c("apple", "banana", "pear")
str_view(string = x, pattern = "an")
```

preserve008ebef084bb8992

有时候，我们希望在字符串中，`a`前后都有字符（a处在两字符中间， rap, bad, sad, wave，spear等等）

```r
x <- c("apple", "banana", "pear")
str_view(x, ".a.")
```

preserve1af78fb6a54b8ba1

这里的`.` 代表任意字符。如果向表达.本身呢？


```r
c("s.d") %>% 
  str_view(".")
```

preservea462676c1b178249


```r
c("s.d") %>% 
  str_view("\\.")
```

preserve5e7773bf833d64f2


### 锚点

希望`a`是字符串的开始

```r
x <- c("apple", "banana", "pear")
str_view(x, "^a")
```

preserveb3c7accf93a20e5b


希望`a`是一字符串的末尾

```r
x <- c("apple", "banana", "pear")
str_view(x, "a$")
```

preserve87095e717562d23d



```r
x <- c("apple pie", "apple", "apple cake")
str_view(x, "^apple$")
```

preservef425bc939fad57d5





### 字符类与字符选项

前面提到，`.`匹配任意字符，事实上还有很多这种**特殊含义**的字符：

* `\d`: matches any digit.
* `\s`: matches any whitespace (e.g. space, tab, newline).
* `[abc]`: matches a, b, or c.
* `[^abc]`: matches anything except a, b, or c.



```r
str_view(c("grey", "gray"), "gr[ea]y")
```

preserve05700fb7ffa9618c








### 重复

控制匹配次数:

* `?`: 0 or 1
* `+`: 1 or more
* `*`: 0 or more




```r
x <- "Roman numerals: MDCCCLXXXVIII"
str_view(x, "CC?")
```

preserve07eb091899b940c9

```r
str_view(x, "X+")
```

preserve6327c0569d24d146





控制匹配次数:

* `{n}`: exactly n
* `{n,}`: n or more
* `{,m}`: at most m
* `{n,m}`: between n and m





```r
x <- "Roman numerals: MDCCCLXXXVIII"
str_view(x, "C{2}")
```

preserve48b9e76b3f0975ce

```r
str_view(x, "C{2,}")
```

preserve4ef0c867e46fb323

```r
str_view(x, "C{2,3}")
```

preserve1e51b0920ce8915e


- 默认的情况，`*`, `+` 匹配都是**贪婪**的，也就是它会尽可能的匹配更多
- 如果想让它不贪婪，而是变得懒惰起来，可以在`*`, `+` 加个`?`




```r
x <- "Roman numerals: MDCCCLXXXVIII"

str_view(x, "CLX+")
```

preserve74038ecb5a98ecb8

```r
str_view(x, "CLX+?")
```

小结一下呢

### 分组与回溯引用



```r
ft <- fruit %>% head(10)
ft
```

```
##  [1] "apple"        "apricot"      "avocado"     
##  [4] "banana"       "bell pepper"  "bilberry"    
##  [7] "blackberry"   "blackcurrant" "blood orange"
## [10] "blueberry"
```

我们想看看这些单词里，有哪些字母是重复两次的，比如`aa`, `pp`. 如果用上面学的方法

```r
str_view(ft, ".{2}", match = TRUE)
```

preserve9e67ed04e8b908d2

发现不是和我们的预想不一样呢。

所以需要用到新技术 **分组与回溯引用**，

```r
str_view(ft, "(.)\\1", match = TRUE)
```

preserve0d00db1144c53540

- `.` 是匹配任何字符
- `(.)` 将匹配项括起来，它就用了一个名字，叫`\\1`； 如果有两个括号，就叫`\\1`和`\\2`
- `\\1` 表示回溯引用，表示引用`\\1`对于的`(.)`

所以`(.)\\1`的意思就是，匹配到了字符，后面还希望有个**同样的字符**


如果是匹配`abab`, `wcwc`

```r
str_view(ft, "(..)\\1", match = TRUE)
```

preserve9691449694f98cc7

如果是匹配`abba`, `wccw`呢？


```r
str_view(ft, "(.)(.)\\2\\1", match = TRUE)
```

是不是很神奇？



## 解决实际问题



### 确定一个字符向量是否匹配一种模式

实际问题中，我们希望得到，是否匹配？或者将匹配的筛选处理，
这个时候，需要用到`str_detect`等函数

```r
x <- c("apple", "banana", "pear")
str_detect(x, "e")
```

```
## [1]  TRUE FALSE  TRUE
```

`stringr::words`包含了牛津字典里常用单词

```r
stringr::words %>% head()
```

```
## [1] "a"        "able"     "about"    "absolute"
## [5] "accept"   "account"
```

我们统计下以`t`开头的单词，有多少个？

```r
# How many common words start with t?
sum(str_detect(words, "^t"))
```

```
## [1] 65
```
我们又一次看到了**强制转换**.


以元音结尾的单词，占比多少？

```r
# proportion of common words end with a vowel?
mean(str_detect(words, "[aeiou]$"))
```

```
## [1] 0.2765
```


放在数据框里看看, 看看以`x`结尾的单词是哪些？

```r
tibble(
  word = words
) %>%
  filter(str_detect(word, "x$"))
```

<div data-pagedtable="false">
  <script data-pagedtable-source type="application/json">
{"columns":[{"label":["word"],"name":[1],"type":["chr"],"align":["left"]}],"data":[{"1":"box"},{"1":"sex"},{"1":"six"},{"1":"tax"}],"options":{"columns":{"min":{},"max":[10]},"rows":{"min":[10],"max":[10]},"pages":{}}}
  </script>
</div>




`str_detect()` 有一个功能类似的函数`str_count()`，区别在于，后者不是简单地返回是或否，而是返回字符串中匹配的数量


```r
x <- c("apple", "banana", "pear")
str_count(x, "a")
```

```
## [1] 1 3 1
```



```r
tibble(
  word = words
) %>%
  mutate(
    vowels = str_count(word, "[aeiou]"),
    consonants = str_count(word, "[^aeiou]")
  )
```

<div data-pagedtable="false">
  <script data-pagedtable-source type="application/json">
{"columns":[{"label":["word"],"name":[1],"type":["chr"],"align":["left"]},{"label":["vowels"],"name":[2],"type":["int"],"align":["right"]},{"label":["consonants"],"name":[3],"type":["int"],"align":["right"]}],"data":[{"1":"a","2":"1","3":"0"},{"1":"able","2":"2","3":"2"},{"1":"about","2":"3","3":"2"},{"1":"absolute","2":"4","3":"4"},{"1":"accept","2":"2","3":"4"},{"1":"account","2":"3","3":"4"},{"1":"achieve","2":"4","3":"3"},{"1":"across","2":"2","3":"4"},{"1":"act","2":"1","3":"2"},{"1":"active","2":"3","3":"3"},{"1":"actual","2":"3","3":"3"},{"1":"add","2":"1","3":"2"},{"1":"address","2":"2","3":"5"},{"1":"admit","2":"2","3":"3"},{"1":"advertise","2":"4","3":"5"},{"1":"affect","2":"2","3":"4"},{"1":"afford","2":"2","3":"4"},{"1":"after","2":"2","3":"3"},{"1":"afternoon","2":"4","3":"5"},{"1":"again","2":"3","3":"2"},{"1":"against","2":"3","3":"4"},{"1":"age","2":"2","3":"1"},{"1":"agent","2":"2","3":"3"},{"1":"ago","2":"2","3":"1"},{"1":"agree","2":"3","3":"2"},{"1":"air","2":"2","3":"1"},{"1":"all","2":"1","3":"2"},{"1":"allow","2":"2","3":"3"},{"1":"almost","2":"2","3":"4"},{"1":"along","2":"2","3":"3"},{"1":"already","2":"3","3":"4"},{"1":"alright","2":"2","3":"5"},{"1":"also","2":"2","3":"2"},{"1":"although","2":"3","3":"5"},{"1":"always","2":"2","3":"4"},{"1":"america","2":"4","3":"3"},{"1":"amount","2":"3","3":"3"},{"1":"and","2":"1","3":"2"},{"1":"another","2":"3","3":"4"},{"1":"answer","2":"2","3":"4"},{"1":"any","2":"1","3":"2"},{"1":"apart","2":"2","3":"3"},{"1":"apparent","2":"3","3":"5"},{"1":"appear","2":"3","3":"3"},{"1":"apply","2":"1","3":"4"},{"1":"appoint","2":"3","3":"4"},{"1":"approach","2":"3","3":"5"},{"1":"appropriate","2":"5","3":"6"},{"1":"area","2":"3","3":"1"},{"1":"argue","2":"3","3":"2"},{"1":"arm","2":"1","3":"2"},{"1":"around","2":"3","3":"3"},{"1":"arrange","2":"3","3":"4"},{"1":"art","2":"1","3":"2"},{"1":"as","2":"1","3":"1"},{"1":"ask","2":"1","3":"2"},{"1":"associate","2":"5","3":"4"},{"1":"assume","2":"3","3":"3"},{"1":"at","2":"1","3":"1"},{"1":"attend","2":"2","3":"4"},{"1":"authority","2":"4","3":"5"},{"1":"available","2":"5","3":"4"},{"1":"aware","2":"3","3":"2"},{"1":"away","2":"2","3":"2"},{"1":"awful","2":"2","3":"3"},{"1":"baby","2":"1","3":"3"},{"1":"back","2":"1","3":"3"},{"1":"bad","2":"1","3":"2"},{"1":"bag","2":"1","3":"2"},{"1":"balance","2":"3","3":"4"},{"1":"ball","2":"1","3":"3"},{"1":"bank","2":"1","3":"3"},{"1":"bar","2":"1","3":"2"},{"1":"base","2":"2","3":"2"},{"1":"basis","2":"2","3":"3"},{"1":"be","2":"1","3":"1"},{"1":"bear","2":"2","3":"2"},{"1":"beat","2":"2","3":"2"},{"1":"beauty","2":"3","3":"3"},{"1":"because","2":"4","3":"3"},{"1":"become","2":"3","3":"3"},{"1":"bed","2":"1","3":"2"},{"1":"before","2":"3","3":"3"},{"1":"begin","2":"2","3":"3"},{"1":"behind","2":"2","3":"4"},{"1":"believe","2":"4","3":"3"},{"1":"benefit","2":"3","3":"4"},{"1":"best","2":"1","3":"3"},{"1":"bet","2":"1","3":"2"},{"1":"between","2":"3","3":"4"},{"1":"big","2":"1","3":"2"},{"1":"bill","2":"1","3":"3"},{"1":"birth","2":"1","3":"4"},{"1":"bit","2":"1","3":"2"},{"1":"black","2":"1","3":"4"},{"1":"bloke","2":"2","3":"3"},{"1":"blood","2":"2","3":"3"},{"1":"blow","2":"1","3":"3"},{"1":"blue","2":"2","3":"2"},{"1":"board","2":"2","3":"3"},{"1":"boat","2":"2","3":"2"},{"1":"body","2":"1","3":"3"},{"1":"book","2":"2","3":"2"},{"1":"both","2":"1","3":"3"},{"1":"bother","2":"2","3":"4"},{"1":"bottle","2":"2","3":"4"},{"1":"bottom","2":"2","3":"4"},{"1":"box","2":"1","3":"2"},{"1":"boy","2":"1","3":"2"},{"1":"break","2":"2","3":"3"},{"1":"brief","2":"2","3":"3"},{"1":"brilliant","2":"3","3":"6"},{"1":"bring","2":"1","3":"4"},{"1":"britain","2":"3","3":"4"},{"1":"brother","2":"2","3":"5"},{"1":"budget","2":"2","3":"4"},{"1":"build","2":"2","3":"3"},{"1":"bus","2":"1","3":"2"},{"1":"business","2":"3","3":"5"},{"1":"busy","2":"1","3":"3"},{"1":"but","2":"1","3":"2"},{"1":"buy","2":"1","3":"2"},{"1":"by","2":"0","3":"2"},{"1":"cake","2":"2","3":"2"},{"1":"call","2":"1","3":"3"},{"1":"can","2":"1","3":"2"},{"1":"car","2":"1","3":"2"},{"1":"card","2":"1","3":"3"},{"1":"care","2":"2","3":"2"},{"1":"carry","2":"1","3":"4"},{"1":"case","2":"2","3":"2"},{"1":"cat","2":"1","3":"2"},{"1":"catch","2":"1","3":"4"},{"1":"cause","2":"3","3":"2"},{"1":"cent","2":"1","3":"3"},{"1":"centre","2":"2","3":"4"},{"1":"certain","2":"3","3":"4"},{"1":"chair","2":"2","3":"3"},{"1":"chairman","2":"3","3":"5"},{"1":"chance","2":"2","3":"4"},{"1":"change","2":"2","3":"4"},{"1":"chap","2":"1","3":"3"},{"1":"character","2":"3","3":"6"},{"1":"charge","2":"2","3":"4"},{"1":"cheap","2":"2","3":"3"},{"1":"check","2":"1","3":"4"},{"1":"child","2":"1","3":"4"},{"1":"choice","2":"3","3":"3"},{"1":"choose","2":"3","3":"3"},{"1":"Christ","2":"1","3":"5"},{"1":"Christmas","2":"2","3":"7"},{"1":"church","2":"1","3":"5"},{"1":"city","2":"1","3":"3"},{"1":"claim","2":"2","3":"3"},{"1":"class","2":"1","3":"4"},{"1":"clean","2":"2","3":"3"},{"1":"clear","2":"2","3":"3"},{"1":"client","2":"2","3":"4"},{"1":"clock","2"

### 确定匹配的位置


大家放心，正则表达式不会重叠匹配。比如用`"aba"`去匹配`"abababa"`，肉眼感觉是三次，但正则表达式告诉我们是两次，因为不会重叠匹配


```r
str_count("abababa", "aba")
```

```
## [1] 2
```



```r
str_view_all("abababa", "aba")
```

preserve3d9d30fc809c63ba





### 提取匹配的内容


```r
colours <- c(
  "red", "orange", "yellow",
  "green", "blue", "purple"
)
colour_match <- str_c(colours, collapse = "|")
colour_match
```

```
## [1] "red|orange|yellow|green|blue|purple"
```

colour_match 这里是一个字符串，放在pattern参数位置上也是正则表达式了,

这里注意以下两者的区别


```r
str_view("abcd", "ab|cd")
str_view("abc", "a[bc]d")
```




```r
more <- "It is hard to erase blue or red ink."
str_extract(more, pattern = colour_match)
```

```
## [1] "blue"
```



```r
str_extract_all(more, pattern = colour_match)
```

```
## [[1]]
## [1] "blue" "red"
```





```r
more <- sentences[str_count(sentences, colour_match) > 1]
more
```

```
## [1] "It is hard to erase blue or red ink."          
## [2] "The green light in the brown box flickered."   
## [3] "The sky in the west is tinged with orange red."
```
取出sentences中，含有有两种和两种颜色以上的句子。不过，不喜欢这种写法，看着费劲，还是用tidyverse的方法

```r
tibble(sentence = sentences) %>% 
  filter(str_count(sentences, colour_match) > 1)
```

<div data-pagedtable="false">
  <script data-pagedtable-source type="application/json">
{"columns":[{"label":["sentence"],"name":[1],"type":["chr"],"align":["left"]}],"data":[{"1":"It is hard to erase blue or red ink."},{"1":"The green light in the brown box flickered."},{"1":"The sky in the west is tinged with orange red."}],"options":{"columns":{"min":{},"max":[10]},"rows":{"min":[10],"max":[10]},"pages":{}}}
  </script>
</div>

`str_extract()`提取匹配, 谁先匹配就提取谁

```r
tibble(x = more) %>%
  mutate(color = str_extract(x, colour_match))
```

<div data-pagedtable="false">
  <script data-pagedtable-source type="application/json">
{"columns":[{"label":["x"],"name":[1],"type":["chr"],"align":["left"]},{"label":["color"],"name":[2],"type":["chr"],"align":["left"]}],"data":[{"1":"It is hard to erase blue or red ink.","2":"blue"},{"1":"The green light in the brown box flickered.","2":"green"},{"1":"The sky in the west is tinged with orange red.","2":"orange"}],"options":{"columns":{"min":{},"max":[10]},"rows":{"min":[10],"max":[10]},"pages":{}}}
  </script>
</div>


`str_extract_all()`提取全部匹配项


```r
tibble(x = more) %>%
  mutate(color = str_extract_all(x, colour_match))
```

<div data-pagedtable="false">
  <script data-pagedtable-source type="application/json">
{"columns":[{"label":["x"],"name":[1],"type":["chr"],"align":["left"]},{"label":["color"],"name":[2],"type":["list"],"align":["right"]}],"data":[{"1":"It is hard to erase blue or red ink.","2":"<chr [2]>"},{"1":"The green light in the brown box flickered.","2":"<chr [2]>"},{"1":"The sky in the west is tinged with orange red.","2":"<chr [2]>"}],"options":{"columns":{"min":{},"max":[10]},"rows":{"min":[10],"max":[10]},"pages":{}}}
  </script>
</div>


```r
tibble(x = more) %>%
  mutate(color = str_extract_all(x, colour_match)) %>% 
  unnest_wider(color)
```

<div data-pagedtable="false">
  <script data-pagedtable-source type="application/json">
{"columns":[{"label":["x"],"name":[1],"type":["chr"],"align":["left"]},{"label":["...1"],"name":[2],"type":["chr"],"align":["left"]},{"label":["...2"],"name":[3],"type":["chr"],"align":["left"]}],"data":[{"1":"It is hard to erase blue or red ink.","2":"blue","3":"red"},{"1":"The green light in the brown box flickered.","2":"green","3":"red"},{"1":"The sky in the west is tinged with orange red.","2":"orange","3":"red"}],"options":{"columns":{"min":{},"max":[10]},"rows":{"min":[10],"max":[10]},"pages":{}}}
  </script>
</div>




### 替换匹配内容


只替换匹配的第一项

```r
x <- c("apple", "pear", "banana")
str_replace(x, "[aeiou]", "-")
```

```
## [1] "-pple"  "p-ar"   "b-nana"
```


替换全部匹配项

```r
str_replace_all(x, "[aeiou]", "-")
```

```
## [1] "-ppl-"  "p--r"   "b-n-n-"
```







### 拆分字符串

这个和`str_c()`是相反的操作


```r
lines <- "I love my country"
lines
```

```
## [1] "I love my country"
```



```r
str_split(lines, " ")
```

```
## [[1]]
## [1] "I"       "love"    "my"      "country"
```



```r
fields <- c("Name: Hadley", "Country: NZ", "Age: 35")
fields %>% str_split(": ", n = 2, simplify = TRUE)
```

```

## [1,] "Name"    "Hadley"
## [2,] "Country" "NZ"

## 进阶部分

带有条件的匹配

### look ahead

想匹配Windows，同时希望Windows右侧是`"95", "98", "NT", "2000"`中的一个

```r
win <- c("Windows2000", "Windows", "Windows3.1")
str_view(win, "Windows(?=95|98|NT|2000)")
```

preserve5faf0c6862f6b5fe




```r
win <- c("Windows2000", "Windows", "Windows3.1")
str_view(win, "Windows(?!95|98|NT|2000)")
```

preserve662744cf22b9ced5



Windows后面的 `()` 是匹配条件，事实上，有四种情形：

- `(?=pattern)`  要求此位置的后面必须匹配表达式pattern
- `(?!pattern)`  要求此位置的后面不能匹配表达式pattern
- `(?<=pattern)` 要求此位置的前面必须匹配表达式pattern
- `(?<!pattern)` 要求此位置的前面不能匹配表达式pattern


<div class="danger">
<p>注意：对于正则表达式引擎来说，它是从文本头部向尾部（从左到右）开始解析的，因此对于文本尾部方向，称为“前”，因为这个时候，正则引擎还没走到那块；而对文本头部方向，则称为“后”，因为正则引擎已经走过了那一块地方。</p>
</div>



### look behind

思考题，

- 如何提取大写字母后的连续数字，比如B217C后面的217
- 如何提取提取数字前的大写字母？
- 为什么第一个正则表达式返回结果为""

# 函数式编程 {#purrr}


很多教材都是讲函数和循环，都是从`for, while, ifelse`讲起
，如果我也这样讲，又回到了Base R的老路上去了。考虑到大家都没有编程背景，也不会立志当程序员，所以我直接讲purrr包，留坑以后填吧。



## 简单回顾

大家知道R常用的数据结构是向量、矩阵、列表和数据框，如下图

<img src="images/data_struction1.png" width="90%" />


他们构造起来，很多相似性。


```r
        list(a = 1, b = "a")   # 列表
           c(a = 1, b = 2)     # 命名向量
  data.frame(a = 1, b = 2)     # 数据框
      tibble(a = 1, b = 2)     # 增强型数据框
```

## 多说说列表

我们构造一个列表


```r
a_list <- list(
  num = c(8, 9),
  log = TRUE,
  cha = c("a", "b", "c")
)
a_list
```

```
## $num
## [1] 8 9
## 
## $log
## [1] TRUE
## 
## $cha
## [1] "a" "b" "c"
```

要想访问某个元素，可以这样

```r
a_list["num"]
```

```
## $num
## [1] 8 9
```
注意返回结果，第一行是`$num`，说明返回的结果仍然是列表, 相比`a_list`来说，`a_list["num"]`是只包含一个元素的列表。

想将num元素里面的向量提取出来，就得用两个`[[`

```r
a_list[["num"]]
```

```
## [1] 8 9
```

大家知道程序员都是偷懒的，为了节省体力，用一个美元符号`$`代替`[[" "]]`六个字符

```r
a_list$num
```

```
## [1] 8 9
```


<img src="images/list_subset.png" width="90%" />


在tidyverse里，还可以用

```r
a_list %>% pluck(1)
```

```
## [1] 8 9
```
或者

```r
a_list %>% pluck("num")
```

```
## [1] 8 9
```


## 列表 vs 向量

假定一向量

```r
v <- c(-2, -1, 0, 1, 2)
v
```

```
## [1] -2 -1  0  1  2
```
我们对元素分别取绝对值

```r
abs(v)
```

```
## [1] 2 1 0 1 2
```

如果是列表形式，`abs`函数应用到列表中就会报错

```r
lst <- list(-2, -1, 0, 1, 2)
```



```r
abs(lst)
```

```
## Error in abs(lst): 数学函数中用了非数值参数
```

报错了。用在向量的函数用在list上，往往行不通。


再来一个例子：我们模拟了5个学生的10次考试的成绩

```r
exams <- list(
  student1 = round(runif(10, 50, 100)),
  student2 = round(runif(10, 50, 100)),
  student3 = round(runif(10, 50, 100)),
  student4 = round(runif(10, 50, 100)),
  student5 = round(runif(10, 50, 100))
)
exams
```

```
## $student1
##  [1] 71 84 68 94 52 53 73 70 95 61
## 
## $student2
##  [1] 57 75 73 74 79 77 97 51 53 65
## 
## $student3
##  [1] 81 64 62 80 74 99 72 51 60 59
## 
## $student4
##  [1] 87 87 93 90 71 67 89 80 97 65
## 
## $student5
##  [1] 86 79 62 67 99 95 87 70 90 72
```

很显然，`exams`是一个列表。那么，每个学生的平均成绩是多呢？

我们可能会想到用mean函数，但是

```r
mean(exams)
```

```
## [1] NA
```

发现报错了，可以看看帮助文档看看问题出在什么地方

```r
?mean()
```

帮助文档告诉我们，`mean()`要求第一个参数是**数值型或者逻辑型**的向量。
而我们这里的`exams`是列表，因此无法运行。

那好，我们就用笨办法吧

```r
list(
  student1 = mean(exams$student1),
  student2 = mean(exams$student2),
  student3 = mean(exams$student3),
  student4 = mean(exams$student4),
  student5 = mean(exams$student5)
)
```

```
## $student1
## [1] 72.1
## 
## $student2
## [1] 70.1
## 
## $student3
## [1] 70.2
## 
## $student4
## [1] 82.6
## 
## $student5
## [1] 80.7
```

成功了。但发现我们写了好多代码，如果有100个学生，那就得写更多的代码，如果是这样，程序员就不高兴了，这太累了啊。于是`purrr`包的`map`函数来解救我们，下面主角出场了。



## purrr

介绍之前，先试试

```r
exams %>% map(mean)
```

```
## $student1
## [1] 72.1
## 
## $student2
## [1] 70.1
## 
## $student3
## [1] 70.2
## 
## $student4
## [1] 82.6
## 
## $student5
## [1] 80.7
```
哇，短短几句话，得出了相同的结果。如果希望返回的是数值型的**向量**，可以这样写

```r
exams %>% map_dbl(mean)
```

```
## student1 student2 student3 student4 student5 
##     72.1     70.1     70.2     82.6     80.7
```

如果希望返回的结果是数据框

```r
exams %>% map_df(mean)
```

<div data-pagedtable="false">
  <script data-pagedtable-source type="application/json">
{"columns":[{"label":["student1"],"name":[1],"type":["dbl"],"align":["right"]},{"label":["student2"],"name":[2],"type":["dbl"],"align":["right"]},{"label":["student3"],"name":[3],"type":["dbl"],"align":["right"]},{"label":["student4"],"name":[4],"type":["dbl"],"align":["right"]},{"label":["student5"],"name":[5],"type":["dbl"],"align":["right"]}],"data":[{"1":"72.1","2":"70.1","3":"70.2","4":"82.6","5":"80.7"}],"options":{"columns":{"min":{},"max":[10]},"rows":{"min":[10],"max":[10]},"pages":{}}}
  </script>
</div>

是不是很酷？



事实上，`map`函数

<img src="images/map_function1.png" width="80%" />

- 第一个参数是列表（数据框是列表的一种特殊形式，因此数据框也是可以的）
- 第二个参数是函数，这个函数会**应用到列表的每一个元素**


`map`函数执行过程如下
：
<img src="images/map_function2.png" width="90%" />

具体为，`exams`有5个元素，一个元素装着一个学生的10次考试成绩，
运行`map(exams, mean)`函数后， 首先取出exams第一个元素`exams$student1`(它是向量)，然后执行
`mean(exams$student1)`, 然后将计算结果存放在列表result中的第一个位置`result1`上；


做完第一个学生的，紧接着取出`exams`第二个元素`exams$student2`，执行
`mean(exams$student2)`, 然后将计算结果存放在列表`result`中的第一个位置`result2`上；


如此这般，直到所有学生都处理完毕。我们得到了最终结果---一个新的列表`result`。


当然，我们也可以根据需要，让map返回我们需要的数据格式, purrr也提供了方便的函数，具体如下

<img src="images/map_function3.png" width="90%" />


我们将`mean`函数换成求方差`var`函数试试，

```r
exams %>% map_df(var)
```

<div data-pagedtable="false">
  <script data-pagedtable-source type="application/json">
{"columns":[{"label":["student1"],"name":[1],"type":["dbl"],"align":["right"]},{"label":["student2"],"name":[2],"type":["dbl"],"align":["right"]},{"label":["student3"],"name":[3],"type":["dbl"],"align":["right"]},{"label":["student4"],"name":[4],"type":["dbl"],"align":["right"]},{"label":["student5"],"name":[5],"type":["dbl"],"align":["right"]}],"data":[{"1":"229","2":"194.8","3":"196","4":"127.2","5":"158.2"}],"options":{"columns":{"min":{},"max":[10]},"rows":{"min":[10],"max":[10]},"pages":{}}}
  </script>
</div>


## 自定义函数

刚才我们是让学生成绩执行求平均`mean`，求方差`var`等函数。我们也可以自定义函数。
比如我们这里定义了将向量**中心化**的函数（先求出10次考试的平均值，然后每次考试成绩去减这个平均值）

```r
my_fun <- function(x){
  x - mean(x)
}

exams %>% map_df(my_fun)
```

<div data-pagedtable="false">
  <script data-pagedtable-source type="application/json">
{"columns":[{"label":["student1"],"name":[1],"type":["dbl"],"align":["right"]},{"label":["student2"],"name":[2],"type":["dbl"],"align":["right"]},{"label":["student3"],"name":[3],"type":["dbl"],"align":["right"]},{"label":["student4"],"name":[4],"type":["dbl"],"align":["right"]},{"label":["student5"],"name":[5],"type":["dbl"],"align":["right"]}],"data":[{"1":"-1.1","2":"-13.1","3":"10.8","4":"4.4","5":"5.3"},{"1":"11.9","2":"4.9","3":"-6.2","4":"4.4","5":"-1.7"},{"1":"-4.1","2":"2.9","3":"-8.2","4":"10.4","5":"-18.7"},{"1":"21.9","2":"3.9","3":"9.8","4":"7.4","5":"-13.7"},{"1":"-20.1","2":"8.9","3":"3.8","4":"-11.6","5":"18.3"},{"1":"-19.1","2":"6.9","3":"28.8","4":"-15.6","5":"14.3"},{"1":"0.9","2":"26.9","3":"1.8","4":"6.4","5":"6.3"},{"1":"-2.1","2":"-19.1","3":"-19.2","4":"-2.6","5":"-10.7"},{"1":"22.9","2":"-17.1","3":"-10.2","4":"14.4","5":"9.3"},{"1":"-11.1","2":"-5.1","3":"-11.2","4":"-17.6","5":"-8.7"}],"options":{"columns":{"min":{},"max":[10]},"rows":{"min":[10],"max":[10]},"pages":{}}}
  </script>
</div>

当然可以偷懒将函数直接写在`map()`里，用`~`代替`my_fun`， 但**代价**是参数必须是规定的写法，比如`.x`

```r
exams %>% map_df(~ .x - mean(.x))
```

<div data-pagedtable="false">
  <script data-pagedtable-source type="application/json">
{"columns":[{"label":["student1"],"name":[1],"type":["dbl"],"align":["right"]},{"label":["student2"],"name":[2],"type":["dbl"],"align":["right"]},{"label":["student3"],"name":[3],"type":["dbl"],"align":["right"]},{"label":["student4"],"name":[4],"type":["dbl"],"align":["right"]},{"label":["student5"],"name":[5],"type":["dbl"],"align":["right"]}],"data":[{"1":"-1.1","2":"-13.1","3":"10.8","4":"4.4","5":"5.3"},{"1":"11.9","2":"4.9","3":"-6.2","4":"4.4","5":"-1.7"},{"1":"-4.1","2":"2.9","3":"-8.2","4":"10.4","5":"-18.7"},{"1":"21.9","2":"3.9","3":"9.8","4":"7.4","5":"-13.7"},{"1":"-20.1","2":"8.9","3":"3.8","4":"-11.6","5":"18.3"},{"1":"-19.1","2":"6.9","3":"28.8","4":"-15.6","5":"14.3"},{"1":"0.9","2":"26.9","3":"1.8","4":"6.4","5":"6.3"},{"1":"-2.1","2":"-19.1","3":"-19.2","4":"-2.6","5":"-10.7"},{"1":"22.9","2":"-17.1","3":"-10.2","4":"14.4","5":"9.3"},{"1":"-11.1","2":"-5.1","3":"-11.2","4":"-17.6","5":"-8.7"}],"options":{"columns":{"min":{},"max":[10]},"rows":{"min":[10],"max":[10]},"pages":{}}}
  </script>
</div>


有时候，程序员觉得`x`还是有点多余，于是更够懒一点，只用`.`， 也是可以的

```r
exams %>% map_df(~ . - mean(.))
```

## 延伸阅读

1、看手册`?purrr::modify()`， 思考下它与`map()`的区别

```r
exams %>% modify(~ . - mean(.))
```

2、他们的区别哪里？函数能否互换？

```r
mtcars %>% map_chr(typeof)
mtcars %>% map_lgl(is.double)
mtcars %>% map_int(n_unique)
mtcars %>% map_dbl(mean)
```

# 探索性数据分析 {#eda}

探索性数据分析（exporatory data analysis）是各种知识的综合运用。本章通过一个案例，讲解探索性数据分析的基本思路，也算是对前面几章内容的一次总结复习。

## 探索性

- 数据准备（对数据要做到心中有数）

  - 描述变量
  - 数据结构
  - 缺失值及其处理


- 数据探索（围绕探索的目标）

  - 数据规整
  - 可视化
  - 建模


## 数据集

这是一个诺贝尔奖获得者的数据集，

<img src="images/nobel_prize_winners_list.jpg" width="80%" style="display: block; margin: auto auto auto 0;" />


## 导入数据

```r
library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)
```



```r
df <- read_csv("./demo_data/nobel_winners.csv")
df 
```

## 数据结构

一行就是一个诺奖获得者的记录? 确定？


缺失值及其处理

```r
df %>% map_df(~sum(is.na(.)))
```

<div data-pagedtable="false">
  <script data-pagedtable-source type="application/json">

性别缺失怎么造成的？

```r
df %>% count(laureate_type)
```

<div data-pagedtable="false">
  <script data-pagedtable-source type="application/json">
{"columns":[{"label":["laureate_type"],"name":[1],"type":["chr"],"align":["left"]},{"label":["n"],"name":[2],"type":["int"],"align":["right"]}],"data":[{"1":"Individual","2":"939"},{"1":"Organization","2":"30"}],"options":{"columns":{"min":{},"max":[10]},"rows":{"min":[10],"max":[10]},"pages":{}}}
  </script>
</div>




## 我们想探索哪些问题？

你想关心哪些问题，可能是

- 每个学科颁过多少次奖？
- 这些大神都是哪个年代的人？
- 性别比例
- 平均年龄和获奖数量
- 最年轻的诺奖获得者是谁？
- 中国诺奖获得者有哪些？
- 得奖的时候多大年龄？
- 获奖者所在国家的经济情况？
- 有大神多次获得诺贝尔奖，而且在不同科学领域获奖？
- 出生地分布？工作地分布？迁移模式？
- GDP经济与诺奖模型？
- 诺奖分享情况？


## 每个学科颁过多少次奖


```r
df %>% count(category)
```

<div data-pagedtable="false">
  <script data-pagedtable-source type="application/json">
{"columns":[{"label":["category"],"name":[1],"type":["chr"],"align":["left"]},{"label":["n"],"name":[2],"type":["int"],"align":["right"]}],"data":[{"1":"Chemistry","2":"194"},{"1":"Economics","2":"83"},{"1":"Literature","2":"113"},{"1":"Medicine","2":"227"},{"1":"Peace","2":"130"},{"1":"Physics","2":"222"}],"options":{"columns":{"min":{},"max":[10]},"rows":{"min":[10],"max":[10]},"pages":{}}}

</div>


```r
df %>%
  count(category) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = category, y = n, fill = category)) +
  geom_col() +
  geom_text(aes(label = n), vjust = -0.25) +
  labs(title = "不同学科诺贝奖获奖次数对比", x = "学科", y = "数量") +
  theme(legend.position = "none")
```

```r
df %>% 
  count(category) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = fct_reorder(category, n), y = n, fill = category)) +
  geom_col() +
  geom_text(aes(label = n), vjust = -0.25) +

  theme(legend.position = "none")
```

<img src="R4DS_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-248-1.png" width="576" />

也可以使用别人定义好的配色方案


```r
library(ggthemr) # install.packages("devtools")
                 # devtools::install_github('cttobin/ggthemr')
ggthemr('dust')

df %>% 
  count(category) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = fct_reorder(category, n), y = n, fill = category)) +
  geom_col() +
  labs(title = "不同学科诺贝奖获奖次数对比", x = "学科", y = "数量") +
  theme(legend.position = "none")
```

<img src="R4DS_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-249-1.png" width="576" />




这个配色方案感觉挺好看的呢，比较适合我这种又挑剔又懒惰的人。


当然，也可以自己DIY，或者使用配色网站的主题方案(https://learnui.design/tools/data-color-picker.html#palette)


```r
df %>% 
  count(category) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = fct_reorder(category, n), y = n)) +
  geom_col(fill = c("#003f5c", "#444e86", "#955196", "#dd5182", "#ff6e54", "#ffa600")
  ) +
  labs(title = "不同学科诺贝奖获奖次数对比", x = "学科", y = "数量") +
  theme(legend.position = "none")
```

<img src="R4DS_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-251-1.png" width="576" />


让图骚动起来吧

```r
library(gganimate) #install.packages("gganimate", dependencies = T)

df %>% 
  count(category) %>%

和ggplot2的分面一样，动态图可以增加数据展示的维度。

我们发现获奖者有多个地址，就会有重复的情况，比如 Charles Kuen Kao在2009年Physics有两次，为什么重复计数了呢？


下面我们去重吧， 去重可以用`distinct()`函数

## 其它

没有回答的问题，大家自己花时间探索下。



## 延伸阅读

- 有些图可以再美化下

根据大家投票，觉得`ggplot2`是最想掌握的技能，我想这就是R语言中最有质感的部分吧。所以，这里专门拿出一节课讲`ggplot2`，也算是补上之前第 \@ref(visual) 章数据可视化没讲的内容。



有几个新的宏包需要提前安装（不是必须的）

```r
install.packages(c("sf", "cowplot"))

install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("thomasp85/patchwork")
devtools::install_github("yutannihilation/gghighlight")
```

如果安装不成功，请先update宏包，再执行上面安装命令

```r
library(tidyverse)
library(gghighlight)
library(cowplot)
library(patchwork)
```


## 一个有趣的案例

如果上面代码不熟悉，可以用第 \@ref(dplyr) 章的代码重新表达，也是一样的

```r
df %>%
  group_by(dataset) %>%
  summarize(
    mean_x = mean(x),
    mean_y = mean(y),
    std_dev_x = sd(x),
    std_dev_y = sd(y),
    corr_x_y = cor(x, y)
  )
```

那么，我们是否能得出结论，每组的数据长的差不多呢？然而，我们画图发现


```r
ggplot(df, aes(x = x, y = y, colour = dataset)) +
  geom_point() +
  # geom_smooth(method = lm) +
  theme(legend.position = "none") +
  facet_wrap(~dataset, ncol = 3)
```

事实上，每张图都相差很大。所以，这里想说明的是，眼见为实。换句话说，可视化是数据探索中非常重要的部分。本章的目的就是带领大家学习ggplot2基本的绘图技能。


## 学习目标

1. Grammer of Graphics

<img src="images/ggplot_template.png" width="70%" />


2. `data`: 数据框data.frame (注意，不支持向量vector和列表list类型）

3. `aes`: 数据框中的变量**映射**到图形属性。什么叫图形属性？就是图中点的位置、形状，大小，颜色等眼睛能看到的东西。什么叫映射？就是一种对应关系，比如数学中的函数`b = f(a)`就是`a`和`b`之间的一种映射关系, `a`的值决定或者控制了`b`的值，在ggplot2语法里，`a`就是我们输入的数据变量，`b`就是图形属性， 这些图形属性包括：
    + x（x轴方向的位置）
    + y（y轴方向的位置）
    + color（点或者线等元素的颜色）
    + size（点或者线等元素的大小）
    + shape（点或者线等元素的形状）
    + alpha（点或者线等元素的透明度）
    
4. `geoms`: 几何对象，确定我们想画什么样的图，一个`geom_***`确定一种图形。更多几何对象推荐阅读[这里](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/)

    + `geom_bar()`
    + `geom_density()`
    + `geom_freqpoly()`
    + `geom_histogram()`
    + `geom_violin()`
    + `geom_boxplot()`
    + `geom_col()`
    + `geom_point()`
    + `geom_smooth()`
    + `geom_tile()`
    + `geom_density2d()`
    + `geom_bin2d()`
    + `geom_hex()`
    + `geom_count()`
    + `geom_text()`
    + `geom_sf()`
    

5. `stats`:   统计变换
6. `scales`:  标度
7. `coord`:   坐标系统
8. `facet`:   分面
9. `layer`：  增加图层
10. `theme`:   主题风格
11. `save`:    保存图片




## 开始

<div class="try">
<p>前面讲到R语言数据类型有字符串型、数值型、因子型、逻辑型、日期型等，ggplot2会将字符串型、因子型、逻辑型、日期型默认为<strong>离散变量</strong>，而数值型默认为<strong>连续变量</strong>。我们在而呈现数据的时候，可能会同时用到多种类型的数据，比如</p>
<ul>
<li><p>一个离散</p></li>
<li><p>一个连续</p></li>
<li><p>两个离散</p></li>
<li><p>两个连续</p></li>
<li><p>一个离散, 一个连续</p></li>
<li><p>三个连续</p></li>
</ul>

### 检查数据

```r
# 是否有缺失值
gapdata %>%
  summarise_all(~ any(is.na(.)))
```

<div data-pagedtable="false">
  <script data-pagedtable-source type="application/json">
{"columns":[{"label":["country"],"name":[1],"type":["lgl"],"align":["right"]},{"label":["continent"],"name":[2],"type":["lgl"],"align":["right"]},{"label":["year"],"name":[3],"type":["lgl"],"align":["right"]},{"label":["lifeExp"],"name":[4],"type":["lgl"],"align":["right"]},{"label":["pop"],"name":[5],"type":["lgl"],"align":["right"]},{"label":["gdpPercap"],"name":[6],"type":["lgl"],"align":["right"]}],"data":[{"1":"FALSE","2":"FALSE","3":"FALSE","4":"FALSE","5":"FALSE","6":"FALSE"}],"options":{"columns":{"min":{},"max":[10]},"rows":{"min":[10],"max":[10]},"pages":{}}}

<p>接下来，我们需要思考我们应该选择什么样的图，呈现这些不同类型的数据，探索数据背后的故事</p>
</div>


## 基本绘图

### 柱状图
常用于一个离散变量


```r
gapdata %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = continent)) + geom_bar()
```

<img src="R4DS_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-301-1.png" width="576" />





```r
gapdata %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = reorder(continent, continent, length))) + geom_bar()
```

<img src="R4DS_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-302-1.png" width="576" />




```r
gapdata %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = reorder(continent, continent, length))) + geom_bar() +
  coord_flip()
```

<img src="R4DS_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-303-1.png" width="576" />




```r
gapdata %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = continent)) + stat_count()
```

<img src="R4DS_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-304-1.png" width="576" />




```r
gapdata %>% count(continent)
```

<div data-pagedtable="false">
  <script data-pagedtable-source type="application/json">
{"columns":[{"label":["continent"],"name":[1],"type":["chr"],"align":["left"]},{"label":["n"],"name":[2],"type":["int"],"align":["right"]}],"data":[{"1":"Africa","2":"624"},{"1":"Americas","2":"300"},{"1":"Asia","2":"396"},{"1":"Europe","2":"360"},{"1":"Oceania","2":"24"}],"options":{"columns":{"min":{},"max":[10]},"rows":{"min":[10],"max":[10]},"pages":{}}}
  </script>
</div>
可见，geom_bar() 自动完成了这个统计，更多geom与stat对应关系见[这里]()




```r
gapdata %>%
  distinct(continent, country) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = continent)) +
  geom_bar()
```

<img src="R4DS_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-306-1.png" width="576" />

我个人比较喜欢先统计，然后画图

```r
gapdata %>%
  distinct(continent, country) %>%
  group_by(continent) %>%
  summarise(num = n()) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = continent, y = num)) +
  geom_col()
```

<img src="R4DS_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-307-1.png" width="576" />



### 直方图
常用于一个连续变量

```r
gapdata %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = lifeExp)) +
  geom_histogram()
```

<img src="R4DS_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-308-1.png" width="576" />



```r
gapdata %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = lifeExp)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1)
```

<img src="R4DS_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-309-1.png" width="576" />



```r
#' histograms, 默认使用 `position = "stack"`
gapdata %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = lifeExp, fill = continent)) +
  geom_histogram()
```

<img src="R4DS_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-310-1.png" width="576" />



```r
#' 使用`position = "identity"`
gapdata %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = lifeExp, fill = continent)) +
  geom_histogram(position = "identity")
```

<img src="R4DS_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-311-1.png" width="576" />



```r
gapdata %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = lifeExp, color = continent)) +
  geom_freqpoly()
```

<img src="R4DS_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-312-1.png" width="576" />



```r
#' smooth histogram = densityplot
gapdata %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = lifeExp)) + geom_density()
```

<img src="R4DS_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-313-1.png" width="576" />

如果不喜欢下面那条线，可以这样

```r
gapdata %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = lifeExp)) + geom_line(stat = "density")
```

<img src="R4DS_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-314-1.png" width="576" />




```r
# adjust 调节bandwidth,
# adjust = 1/2 means use half of the default bandwidth.
gapdata %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = lifeExp)) + geom_density(adjust = 1)
```

<img src="R4DS_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-315-1.png" width="576" />

```r
gapdata %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = lifeExp)) + geom_density(adjust = 0.2)
```

<img src="R4DS_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-315-2.png" width="576" />



```r
gapdata %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = lifeExp, color = continent)) +
  geom_density()
```

<img src="R4DS_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-316-1.png" width="576" />



```r
gapdata %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = lifeExp, fill = continent)) +
  geom_density(alpha = 0.2)
```

<img src="R4DS_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-317-1.png" width="576" />



```r
gapdata %>%
  filter(continent != "Oceania") %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = lifeExp, fill = continent)) +
  geom_density(alpha = 0.2)
```

<img src="R4DS_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-318-1.png" width="576" />



```r
gapdata %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = lifeExp)) +
  geom_density() +
  # facet_wrap(vars(continent))
  facet_grid(. ~ continent)
```

<img src="R4DS_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-319-1.png" width="576" />





```r
gapdata %>%
  filter(continent != "Oceania") %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = lifeExp, fill = continent)) +
  geom_histogram() +
  facet_grid(continent ~ .)
```

<img src="R4DS_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-320-1.png" width="576" />


直方图和密度图画在一起。注意`y = stat(density) `表示y是由x新生成的变量，这是一种固定写法，类似的还有`stat(count)`

```r
gapdata %>%
  filter(continent != "Oceania") %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = lifeExp, y = stat(density))) +
  geom_histogram(aes(fill = continent)) +
  geom_density() +
  facet_grid(continent ~ .)
```

<img src="R4DS_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-321-1.png" width="576" />


### 箱线图
一个离散变量 + 一个连续变量

```r
#' 思考下结果为什么是这样？
gapdata %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = lifeExp)) + geom_boxplot()
```

<img src="R4DS_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-322-1.png" width="576" />



```r
# 数据框中的year变量是数值型，需要先转换成因子型，弄成离散型变量
gapdata %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = as.factor(year), y = lifeExp)) + geom_boxplot()
```

<img src="R4DS_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-323-1.png" width="576" />





```r
# 明确指定分组变量
gapdata %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = lifeExp)) + geom_boxplot(aes(group = year))
```

<img src="R4DS_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-324-1.png" width="576" />





```r
gapdata %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = lifeExp)) +
  geom_violin(aes(group = year)) +
  geom_jitter(alpha = 1 / 4) +
  geom_smooth(se = FALSE)
```

<img src="R4DS_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-325-1.png" width="576" />



### 抖散图

点重叠的处理方案


```r
gapdata %>% ggplot(aes(x = continent, y = lifeExp)) + geom_point()
```

<img src="R4DS_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-326-1.png" width="576" />



```r
gapdata %>% ggplot(aes(x = continent, y = lifeExp)) + geom_jitter()
```

<img src="R4DS_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-327-1.png" width="576" />



```r
gapdata %>% ggplot(aes(x = continent, y = lifeExp)) + geom_boxplot()
```

<img src="R4DS_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-328-1.png" width="576" />


```r
gapdata %>% ggplot(aes(x = continent, y = lifeExp)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  geom_jitter()
```

<img src="R4DS_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-329-1.png" width="576" />



```r
gapdata %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = continent, y = lifeExp)) +
  geom_jitter() +
  stat_summary(fun.y = median, colour = "red", geom = "point", size = 5)
```

<img src="R4DS_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-330-1.png" width="576" />





```r
gapdata %>%
  ggplot(aes(reorder(x = continent, lifeExp), y = lifeExp)) +
  geom_jitter() +
  stat_summary(fun.y = median, colour = "red", geom = "point", size = 5)
```

<img src="R4DS_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-331-1.png" width="576" />


```r
gapdata %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = continent, y = lifeExp)) +
  geom_violin(
    trim = FALSE,
    alpha = 0.5
  ) +
  stat_summary(
    fun.y = mean,
    fun.ymax = function(x) {
      mean(x) + sd(x)
    },
    fun.ymin = function(x) {
      mean(x) - sd(x)
    },

### 2D 密度图

与一维的情形`geom_density()`类似，
`geom_density_2d()`, `geom_bin2d()`, `geom_hex()`常用于刻画两个变量构成的二维区间的密度



```r
gapdata %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp)) +
  geom_bin2d()
```

<img src="R4DS_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-353-1.png" width="576" />



```r
gapdata %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp)) +
  geom_hex()
```

<img src="R4DS_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-354-1.png" width="576" />



### 马赛克图

`geom_tile()`， `geom_contour()`， `geom_raster()`常用于3个变量


```r
gapdata %>%
  group_by(continent, year) %>%
  summarise(mean_lifeExp = mean(lifeExp)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = continent, fill = mean_lifeExp)) +
  geom_tile() +
  scale_fill_viridis_c()
```

<img src="R4DS_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-355-1.png" width="576" />

事实上可以有更好的呈现方式


```r
gapdata %>%
  group_by(continent, year) %>%
  summarise(mean_lifeExp = mean(lifeExp)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = continent, size = mean_lifeExp)) +

## 定制

### Labels 


```r

  ggplot(aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp, color = continent)) +
  geom_point() +
  scale_x_log10() +
  ggtitle("My Plot Title") +
  xlab("The X Variable") +
  ylab("The Y Variable")
```

<img src="R4DS_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-368-1.png" width="576" />




```r
gapdata %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp, color = continent)) +
  geom_point() +
  scale_x_log10() +
  labs(
    title = "My Plot Title",
    subtitle = "My Plot subtitle",
    x = "The X Variable",
    y = "The Y Variable"
  )
```

<img src="R4DS_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-369-1.png" width="576" />





### 定制颜色

 我喜欢用这两个函数定制喜欢的绘图色彩，`scale_colour_manual()` 和 `scale_fill_manual()`. 更多方法可以参考 [Colours chapter in Cookbook for R](http://www.cookbook-r.com/Graphs/Colors_(ggplot2)/) 


```r
gapdata %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp, color = continent)) +
  geom_point() +
  scale_x_log10() +
  scale_color_manual(
    values = c("#195744", "#008148", "#C6C013", "#EF8A17", "#EF2917")
  )
```

<img src="R4DS_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-370-1.png" width="576" />
 

## 组合图片

我们有时候想把多张图组合到一起

### cowplot

可以使用 [`cowplot`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/cowplot/vignettes/introduction.html) 宏包的`plot_grid()`函数完成多张图片的组合，使用方法很简单。


```r
p1 <- gapdata %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = lifeExp > mean(lifeExp))) +
  scale_x_log10() +
  theme(legend.position = "none") +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("orange", "pink")) +
  labs(
    title = "My Plot Title",
    x = "The X Variable",
    y = "The Y Variable"
  )
```



```r
p2 <- gapdata %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp, color = continent)) +
  geom_point() +
  scale_x_log10() +
  scale_color_manual(
    values = c("#195744", "#008148", "#C6C013", "#EF8A17", "#EF2917")
  ) +
  theme(legend.position = "none") +
  labs(
    title = "My Plot Title",
    x = "The X Variable",
    y = "The Y Variable"
  )
```



```r
cowplot::plot_grid(
  p1,
  p2,
  labels = c("A", "B")
)
```

<img src="R4DS_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-373-1.png" width="576" />


也可以使用patchwork宏包，更简单的方法

```r
library(patchwork)
p1 + p2
```

<img src="R4DS_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-374-1.png" width="576" />



```r
p1 / p2
```

<img src="R4DS_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-375-1.png" width="576" />

patchwork 使用方法很简单，根本不需要记
<img src="images/patchwork.png" width="70%" />





### 保存图片

使用`ggsave()`函数，将图片保存为所需要的格式，如".pdf", ".png"等， 还可以指定图片的高度和宽度，默认`units`是英寸，也可以使用"cm", or "mm".


```r
pp <- gapdata %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp, color = continent)) +
  geom_point() +
  scale_x_log10() +
  scale_color_manual(
    values = c("#195744", "#008148", "#C6C013", "#EF8A17", "#EF2917")
  ) +
  theme(legend.position = "none") +
  labs(
    title = "My Plot Title",
    x = "The X Variable",
    y = "The Y Variable"
  )

# ggsave("demo_plot.pdf", plot = pp, width = 8, height = 6)
```



## 中文字体

```r
library(showtext)
showtext_auto()

gapdata %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp, color = continent)) +
  geom_point() +
  scale_x_log10() +
  scale_color_manual(
    values = c("#195744", "#008148", "#C6C013", "#EF8A17", "#EF2917")
  ) +
  theme(legend.position = "none") +
  labs(
    title = "这是我的标题美美哒",
    x = "这是我的x坐标",
    y = "这是我的y坐标"
  )
```

<img src="R4DS_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-377-1.png" width="576" />

```r
# ggsave("myfirst.pdf", width = 8, height = 6)
```



## 高亮某一组
画图很容易，然而画一张好图，不容易。图片质量好不好，其原则就是**不增加看图者的心智负担**，有些图片的色彩很丰富，然而需要看图人配合文字和图注等信息才能看懂作者想表达的意思，这样就失去了图片“一图胜千言”的价值。


分析数据过程中，我们可以使用**高亮**我们某组数据，**突出**我们想表达的信息，是非常好的一种可视化探索手段。


### ggplot2方法

这种方法是将**背景部分**和**高亮部分**分两步来画


```r
drop_facet <- function(x) select(x, -continent)

gapdata %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_line(
    data = drop_facet,
    aes(x = year, y = lifeExp, group = country), color = "grey",
  ) +
  geom_line(aes(x = year, y = lifeExp, color = country, group = country)) +
  facet_wrap(vars(continent)) +
  theme(legend.position = "none")
```

<img src="R4DS_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-378-1.png" width="576" />

再来一个

```r
gapdata %>%
  mutate(group = country) %>%
  filter(continent == "Asia") %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_line(
    data = function(d) select(d, -country),
    aes(x = year, y = lifeExp, group = group), color = "grey",
  ) +
  geom_line(aes(x = year, y = lifeExp, group = country), color = "red") +
  facet_wrap(vars(country)) +
  theme(legend.position = "none")
```

<img src="R4DS_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-379-1.png" width="768" />




### gghighlight方法

这里推荐[gghighlight宏包](<https://yutannihilation.github.io/gghighlight/articles/gghighlight.html>)

- dplyr has filter()
- ggplot has Highlighting


```r
gapdata %>% filter(country == "China")

```r

## 函数图

有时候我们想画一个函数图，比如正态分布的函数，可能会想到先产生数据，然后画图，比如下面的代码


```r
tibble(x = seq(from = -3, to = 3, by = .01)) %>%
  mutate(y = dnorm(x, mean = 0, sd = 1)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = x, y = y)) +
  geom_line(color = "grey33")
```

<img src="R4DS_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-384-1.png" width="576" />


事实上，`stat_function()`可以简化这个过程

```r
ggplot(data = data.frame(x = c(-3, 3)), aes(x = x)) +
  stat_function(fun = dnorm)
```

<img src="R4DS_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-385-1.png" width="576" />


当然我们也可以绘制自定义函数

```r
myfun <- function(x) {
  (x - 1)**2
}

ggplot(data = data.frame(x = c(-1, 3)), aes(x = x)) +
  stat_function(fun = myfun, geom = "line", colour = "red")
```

<img src="R4DS_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-386-1.png" width="576" />


下面这是一个很不错的例子，细细体会下

```r
d <- tibble(x = rnorm(2000, mean = 2, sd = 4))

ggplot(data = d, aes(x = x)) +
  geom_histogram(aes(y = stat(density))) +
  geom_density() +
  stat_function(fun = dnorm, args = list(mean = 2, sd = 4), colour = "red")
```

<img src="R4DS_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-387-1.png" width="576" />

## 地图

> 小时候画地图很容易，长大了画地图却不容易了。

这是一个公园🏞地图和公园里松鼠🐿数量的数据集


```r
nyc_squirrels <- read_csv("./demo_data/nyc_squirrels.csv")
central_park <- sf::read_sf("./demo_data/central_park")
```


先来一个地图，


```r
ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data = central_park)
```

<img src="R4DS_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-389-1.png" width="576" />

一个`geom_sf`就搞定了🥂，貌似没那么难呢？ 好吧，换个姿势，在地图上标注松鼠出现的位置




```r
nyc_squirrels %>%
  drop_na(primary_fur_color) %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data = central_park, color = "grey85") +
  geom_point(
    aes(x = long, y = lat, color = primary_fur_color),
    size = .8
  )
```

<img src="R4DS_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-390-1.png" width="576" />

分开画呢

```r
nyc_squirrels %>%
  drop_na(primary_fur_color) %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data = central_park, color = "grey85") +
  geom_point(
    aes(x = long, y = lat, color = primary_fur_color),
    size = .8
  ) +
  facet_wrap(vars(primary_fur_color)) +
  theme(legend.position = "none")
```

<img src="R4DS_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-391-1.png" width="100%" />






```r
label_colors <-
  c("all squirrels" = "grey75", "highlighted group" = "#0072B2")

nyc_squirrels %>%
  drop_na(primary_fur_color) %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data = central_park, color = "grey85") +
  geom_point(
    data = function(x) select(x, -primary_fur_color),
    aes(x = long, y = lat, color = "all squirrels"),
    size = .8
  ) +
  geom_point(
    aes(x = long, y = lat, color = "highlighted group"),
    size = .8
  ) +
  cowplot::theme_map(16) +
  theme(
    legend.position = "bottom",
    legend.justification = "center"
  ) +
  facet_wrap(vars(primary_fur_color)) +
  scale_color_manual(name = NULL, values = label_colors) +
  guides(color = guide_legend(override.aes = list(size = 2)))
```

<img src="R4DS_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-392-1.png" width="100%" />


```r
# ggsave("Squirrels.pdf", width = 9, height = 6)
```


当然，也可以用`gghighlight`的方法

```r
nyc_squirrels %>%
  drop_na(primary_fur_color) %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data = central_park, color = "grey85") +
  geom_point(
    aes(x = long, y = lat, color = primary_fur_color),
    size = .8
  ) +
  gghighlight(
    label_key = primary_fur_color,
    use_direct_label = FALSE
  ) +
  facet_wrap(vars(primary_fur_color)) +
  cowplot::theme_map(16) +
  theme(legend.position = "none")
```

# 模拟与抽样 {#sampling}



```r
library(tidyverse)
```

本章目的是在tidyverse的架构下，介绍一些基本统计的知识。先回顾下Hadley Wickham提出的数据科学tidy原则，tidy思想体现在:

- 任何数据都可以规整为数据框 
- 数据框的一列代表一个**变量**，数据框的一行代表一次**观察**
- 函数处理数据时，数据框进、数据框出

## 模拟

### 生成随机数

比如生成5个高斯分布的随机数，高斯分布就是正态分布，R语言里我们用`rnorm()`函数产生正态分布的随机数

```r
rnorm(n = 5, mean = 0, sd = 1)
```

```
## [1] -0.04524 -0.67590  0.55463  0.13843  0.49878
```

事实上，R内置了很多随机数产生的函数

| Distrution 	| Notation 		| R |
|----------	|:-------------:|:-------------:|
|Uniform | $\text{U}(a, b)$ | `runif`|
|Normal  | $\text{N}(\mu, \sigma)$ | `rnorm`|
|Binormal  | $\text{Bin}(n, p)$ | `rbinorm`|
|Piosson  | $\text{pois}(\lambda)$ | `rpois`|
|Beta  | $\text{Beta}(\alpha, \beta)$ | `rbeta`|

如果大家查看帮助文档`?runif`，会发现每种**分布**都有对应的四个函数

- d:density 
- p:cumulative probability 
- q:quantile 
- r:random 



在tidyverse的框架下，我们喜欢在数据框(data.frame)下运用这些函数，因为这样我们可以方便使用ggplot2来可视化，

- 例子1，我们生成100个正态分布的点，然后看看其分布

```r
tibble(
  x = rnorm(n = 100, mean = 0, sd = 1)
) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = x)) +
  geom_density()
```

<img src="R4DS_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-397-1.png" width="576" />


我们将模拟的正态分布和理论上正态分布画在一起

```r
tibble(
  x = rnorm(n = 100, mean = 0, sd = 1)
) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = x)) +
  geom_density() +
  stat_function(
    fun = dnorm,
    args = list(mean = 0, sd = 1),
    color = "red"
  )
```

<img src="R4DS_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-398-1.png" width="576" />
如果我们模拟点再增加点，会越来越逼近理论上的分布。



- 例子2，在数据框(data.frame)下，建立模拟$x$和$y$的线性关系

$$ y_i  = 4 + 3.2\, x_i$$
现实中，观察值往往会带入误差，假定误差服从正态分布，那么$x$和$y$的线性关系重新表述为
$$ y_i  = 4 + 3.2\, x_i + \epsilon_i, \quad \epsilon \in \text{Normal}(\mu =0, \sigma =1) $$


```r
sim_normal <- tibble(
  x = seq(0, 1, length.out = 100),
  yexp = 4 + 3.2 * x,
  yobs = yexp + rnorm(100, mean = 0, sd = 1) # 误差服从高斯分布
)

sim_normal %>% head()
```

<div data-pagedtable="false">
  <script data-pagedtable-source type="application/json">
{"columns":[{"label":["x"],"name":[1],"type":["dbl"],"align":["right"]},{"label":["yexp"],"name":[2],"type":["dbl"],"align":["right"]},{"label":["yobs"],"name":[3],"type":["dbl"],"align":["right"]}],"data":[{"1":"0.00000","2":"4.000","3":"3.264"},{"1":"0.01010","2":"4.032","3":"5.540"},{"1":"0.02020","2":"4.065","3":"5.187"},{"1":"0.03030","2":"4.097","3":"6.642"},{"1":"0.04040","2":"4.129","3":"4.113"},{"1":"0.05051","2":"4.162","3":"3.785"}],"options":{"columns":{"min":{},"max":[10]},"rows":{"min":[10],"max":[10]},"pages":{}}}

```r

  ggplot(aes(x = x, y = yexp)) +
  geom_line(color = "red", size = 2) +
  geom_point(aes(y = yobs))
```

## 抽样与样本


### 总体分布
假定一个事实，川师男生总体的平均身高和身高的方差分别为

```r
true.mean <- 175.7
true.sd <- 15.19
```

那么我们可以模拟分布情况如下


```r
pop.distn <-
  tibble(
    height = seq(100, 250, 0.5),
    density = dnorm(height, mean = true.mean, sd = true.sd)
  )

ggplot(pop.distn) +
  geom_line(aes(height, density)) +
  geom_vline(
    xintercept = true.mean,
    color = "red",
    linetype = "dashed"
  ) +
  geom_vline(
    xintercept = true.mean + true.sd,
    color = "blue",
    linetype = "dashed"
  ) +
  geom_vline(
    xintercept = true.mean - true.sd,
    color = "blue",
    linetype = "dashed"
  ) +
  labs(
    x = "Height (cm)", y = "Density",
    title = "川师男生身高分布"
  )
```

<img src="R4DS_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-402-1.png" width="576" />

### 样本
假定我们从中抽取30个男生身高样本


```r
sample.a <-
  tibble(height = rnorm(n = 30, mean = true.mean, sd = true.sd))
```

然后看看样本的直方图


```r
sample.a %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = height)) +
  geom_histogram(aes(y = stat(density)),
    fill = "steelblue",
    alpha = 0.75,
    bins = 10
  ) +
  geom_line(
    data = pop.distn,
    aes(x = height, y = density),
    alpha = 0.25, size = 1.5
  ) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = true.mean, linetype = "dashed", color = "red") +
  geom_vline(xintercept = mean(sample.a$height), linetype = "solid")
```

<img src="R4DS_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-404-1.png" width="576" />

红色的虚线代表分布的总体的均值，黑色实线代表30个样本的均值，


```r
sample.a %>%
  summarize(
    sample.mean = mean(height),
    sample.sd = sd(height)
  )
```

<div data-pagedtable="false">
  <script data-pagedtable-source type="application/json">
{"columns":[{"label":["sample.mean"],"name":[1],"type":["dbl"],"align":["right"]},{"label":["sample.sd"],"name":[2],"type":["dbl"],"align":["right"]}],"data":[{"1":"182.1","2":"16.18"}],"options":{"columns":{"min":{},"max":[10]},"rows":{"min":[10],"max":[10]},"pages":{}}}
  </script>

也就是说，基于这30个观察值的样本，我们认为川师男生的身高均值为182.1486cm，方差为16.1765


可能有同学说，这个样本太少了，计算的均值还不够科学，会以偏概全。于是又重新找了30个男生，和上次类似，用`rnorm`函数模拟，我们记为样本b


```r
sample.b <-
  tibble(height = rnorm(30, mean = true.mean, sd = true.sd))
```

再来看看这次样本的分布

```r
sample.b %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = height)) +
  geom_histogram(aes(y = stat(density)),
    fill = "steelblue", alpha = 0.75, bins = 10
  ) +
  geom_line(
    data = pop.distn, aes(x = height, y = density),
    alpha = 0.25, size = 1.5
  ) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = true.mean, linetype = "dashed", color = "red") +
  geom_vline(xintercept = mean(sample.a$height), linetype = "solid")
```

<img src="R4DS_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-407-1.png" width="576" />

同样，我们计算样本b的均值和方差


```r
sample.b %>%
  summarize(
    sample.mean = mean(height),
    sample.sd = sd(height)
  )
```

<div data-pagedtable="false">
  <script data-pagedtable-source type="application/json">
{"columns":[{"label":["sample.mean"],"name":[1],"type":["dbl"],"align":["right"]},{"label":["sample.sd"],"name":[2],"type":["dbl"],"align":["right"]}],"data":[{"1":"176.4","2":"15.74"}],"options":{"columns":{"min":{},"max":[10]},"rows":{"min":[10],"max":[10]},"pages":{}}}
  </script>
</div>


这次抽样的结果，均值为176.3689cm，方差为15.7398

和样本a比，有一点点变化。不经想问，我能否继续抽样呢？结果会有变化吗？为了避免重复写代码
，我把上面的过程整合到一起，写一个**子函数**，专门模拟抽样过程


```r
rnorm.stats <- function(n, mu, sigma) {
  the.sample <- rnorm(n, mu, sigma)
  tibble(
    sample.size = n,
    sample.mean = mean(the.sample),
    sample.sd = sd(the.sample)
  )
}
```

于是，我们又可以继续模拟了。注意我们之前设定的总体分布的均值和方差

```r
true.mean <- 175.7
true.sd <- 15.19
```


```r
rnorm.stats(30, true.mean, true.sd)
```

<div data-pagedtable="false">
  <script data-pagedtable-source type="application/json">
{"columns":[{"label":["sample.size"],"name":[1],"type":["dbl"],"align":["right"]},{"label":["sample.mean"],"name":[2],"type":["dbl"],"align":["right"]},{"label":["sample.sd"],"name":[3],"type":["dbl"],"align":["right"]}],"data":[{"1":"30","2":"177.2","3":"15.17"}],"options":{"columns":{"min":{},"max":[10]},"rows":{"min":[10],"max":[10]},"pages":{}}}
  </script>
</div>
yes，代码工作的很好，但不过只是代码减少了一点点，仍然只是一次抽样（这里30个样本为一次抽样），**我们的目的是反复抽样**， 抽很多次的那种喔。


那我们用`purrr`包的`rerun`函数偷个懒，


```r
df.samples.of.30 <-
  purrr::rerun(2500, rnorm.stats(30, true.mean, true.sd)) %>%
  dplyr::bind_rows()
```
哇，一下子抽了2500个样本,全部装进了`df.sample.of.30`这个数据框， 偷偷看一眼呢

```r
df.samples.of.30 %>% head()
```

<div data-pagedtable="false">
  <script data-pagedtable-source type="application/json">
{"columns":[{"label":["sample.size"],"name":[1],"type":["dbl"],"align":["right"]},{"label":["sample.mean"],"name":[2],"type":["dbl"],"align":["right"]},{"label":["sample.sd"],"name":[3],"type":["dbl"],"align":["right"]}],"data":[{"1":"30","2":"176.2","3":"15.15"},{"1":"30","2":"174.8","3":"18.01"},{"1":"30","2":"177.7","3":"16.25"},{"1":"30","2":"174.4","3":"17.10"},{"1":"30","2":"176.7","3":"13.65"},{"1":"30","2":"172.4","3":"15.38"}],"options":{"columns":{"min":{},"max":[10]},"rows":{"min":[10],"max":[10]},"pages":{}}}
  </script>
</div>

回过头看看`df.samples.of.30`是什么：

 - 从川师的男生中随机抽取30个，计算这30个人身高的均值和方差，这叫一次抽样
 - 把上面的工作，重复2500次，得到2500个均值和方差
 - 2500个均值和方差，组成了一个数据框
 
 
 
我们发现每次抽样的均值都不一样，感觉又像一个分布(抽样的均值分布)，我们画出来看看吧

```r
df.samples.of.30 %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = sample.mean, y = stat(density))) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 25, fill = "firebrick", alpha = 0.5) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = true.mean, linetype = "dashed", color = "red") +
  labs(
    title = "抽样2500次（每次30个男生）身高均值的分布",
    subtitle = "Distribution of mean heights for 2500 samples of size 30"
  )
```

<img src="R4DS_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-414-1.png" width="576" />
注意到，这不是男生身高的分布，而是**每次抽样计算的均值**构成的分布.

为了更清楚的说明，我们把**整体的分布(灰色曲线)、样本a（蓝色直方图）、抽样的均值分布（红色直方图）**三者画在一起。



```r
df.samples.of.30 %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = sample.mean, y = stat(density))) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 50, fill = "firebrick", alpha = 0.5) +
  geom_histogram(
    data = sample.a,
    aes(x = height, y = stat(density)),
    bins = 11, fill = "steelblue", alpha = 0.25
  ) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = true.mean, linetype = "dashed", color = "red") +
  geom_line(data = pop.distn, aes(x = height, y = density), alpha = 0.25, size = 1.5) +
  xlim(125, 225)
```

<img src="R4DS_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-415-1.png" width="576" />

样本的均值分布，是个很有意思的结果，比如，我们**再选30个男生**再抽样一次，我们可以断定，这次抽样的均值会落在了红色的区间之内。

然而，注意到，必须限定再次抽样的大小仍然是30个男生，以上这句话才成立。



```r
df.samples.of.30 %>%
  summarize(
    mean.of.means = mean(sample.mean),
    sd.of.means = sd(sample.mean)
  )
```

<div data-pagedtable="false">
  <script data-pagedtable-source type="application/json">
{"columns":[{"label":["mean.of.means"],"name":[1],"type":["dbl"],"align":["right"]},{"label":["sd.of.means"],"name":[2],"type":["dbl"],"align":["right"]}],"data":[{"1":"175.6","2":"2.801"}],"options":{"columns":{"min":{},"max":[10]},"rows":{"min":[10],"max":[10]},"pages":{}}}
  </script>
</div>

这里计算的是抽样(样本大小为30)均值分布，而不是整体的均值分布。言外之意，样本大小可以是其它的呗， 那就把样本调整为50、100、250、500分别试试看

```r
df.samples.of.50 <-
  rerun(2500, rnorm.stats(50, true.mean, true.sd)) %>%
  bind_rows()

df.samples.of.100 <-
  rerun(2500, rnorm.stats(100, true.mean, true.sd)) %>%
  bind_rows()

df.samples.of.250 <-
  rerun(2500, rnorm.stats(250, true.mean, true.sd)) %>%
  bind_rows()

df.samples.of.500 <-
  rerun(2500, rnorm.stats(500, true.mean, true.sd)) %>%
  bind_rows()
```
忍不住想画图看看，每次抽取的男生数量不同，均值的分布会有不同？

```r
df.combined <-
  bind_rows(
    df.samples.of.30,
    df.samples.of.50,
    df.samples.of.100,
    df.samples.of.250,
    df.samples.of.500
  ) %>%
  mutate(sample.sz = as.factor(sample.size))
```



```r
df.combined %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = sample.mean, y = stat(density), fill = sample.sz)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 25, alpha = 0.5) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = true.mean, linetype = "dashed") +
  facet_wrap(vars(sample.sz), nrow = 1) +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Set1") +
  labs(
    x = "Sample means", y = "Density",
    title = "Distribution of mean heights for samples of varying size"
  )
```

<img src="R4DS_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-419-1.png" width="960" />

随着样本大小由30增加到500，抽样的均值分布围绕着越来越聚合到实际的均值，或者说随着样本大小的增多，对均值估计的不确定性越小。 


```r
sampling.distn.mean.table <-
  df.combined %>%
  group_by(sample.size) %>%
  summarize(
    mean.of.means = mean(sample.mean),
    sd.of.means = sd(sample.mean)
  )
sampling.distn.mean.table
```

<div data-pagedtable="false">
  <script data-pagedtable-source type="application/json">
{"columns":[{"label":["sample.size"],"name":[1],"type":["dbl"],"align":["right"]},{"label":["mean.of.means"],"name":[2],"type":["dbl"],"align":["right"]},{"label":["sd.of.means"],"name":[3],"type":["dbl"],"align":["right"]}],"data":[{"1":"30","2":"175.6","3":"2.8014"},{"1":"50","2":"175.7","3":"2.1149"},{"1":"100","2":"175.7","3":"1.5016"},{"1":"250","2":"175.7","3":"0.9580"},{"1":"500","2":"175.7","3":"0.6776"}],"options":{"columns":{"min":{},"max":[10]},"rows":{"min":[10],"max":[10]},"pages":{}}}
  </script>
</div>

有个统计学上的概念需要明确。

输出结果的第三列`sd.of.means` 是不同样本大小(30,50,100,250,500)下，反复抽样后平均数分布的标准差。


数学上，如果已知总体的标准差($\sigma$)，那么抽取无限多份大小为 $n$ 的样本，每个样本各有一个平均值，所有这个大小的样本之平均值的标准差可证明为

$$
\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}
$$
即，**平均值的标准误差**。



下面我们画图看看，模拟出来的$sd.of.means$和理论值$\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}$是否一致。

注意到这里的$\sigma$是总体的标准差，即最开始我们设定的川师男生身高的标准差`true.sd`. 也就说，理论上


```r
df.se.mean.theory <- tibble(
  sample.size = seq(10,500,10)
  ) %>% 
  mutate(std.error = true.sd/sqrt(sample.size))

df.se.mean.theory
```

<div data-pagedtable="false">

  geom_point() +

            data = df.se.mean.theory,

  labs(
    x = "Sample size", y = "Std Error of Mean",

  )
```

<img src="R4DS_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-422-1.png" width="576" />

两者吻合的很好。



刚刚我们看到的，**抽样均值分布**随着**样本大小**变化而变化。可以试想下，抽样的其他统计量分布（方差，中位数），是不是也随着样本大小变化而变化呢？




```r
sampling.distn.sd.table <-
  df.combined %>%
  group_by(sample.size) %>%
  summarize(
    mean.of.sds = mean(sample.sd),
    sd.of.sds = sd(sample.sd)
  )

sampling.distn.sd.table
```

<div data-pagedtable="false">
  <script data-pagedtable-source type="application/json">
{"columns":[{"label":["sample.size"],"name":[1],"type":["dbl"],"align":["right"]},{"label":["mean.of.sds"],"name":[2],"type":["dbl"],"align":["right"]},{"label":["sd.of.sds"],"name":[3],"type":["dbl"],"align":["right"]}],"data":[{"1":"30","2":"15.07","3":"1.9772"},{"1":"50","2":"15.15","3":"1.5068"},{"1":"100","2":"15.20","3":"1.0871"},{"1":"250","2":"15.17","3":"0.6918"},{"1":"500","2":"15.18","3":"0.4733"}],"options":{"columns":{"min":{},"max":[10]},"rows":{"min":[10],"max":[10]},"pages":{}}}
  </script>
</div>

答案是肯定的，样本量的增多，抽样方差的不确定性减少。

## 双因素方差分析

我们采用`ggpubr`宏包下的`ToothGrowth`来说明，这个数据集包含60个样本，记录着每10只豚鼠在不同的喂食方法和不同的药物剂量下，牙齿的生长情况.

- len :  牙齿长度
- supp : 两种喂食方法 (橙汁和维生素C)
- dose : 抗坏血酸剂量 (0.5, 1, and 2 mg) 



```r
library("ggpubr")
my_data <- ToothGrowth %>%
  mutate_at(vars(supp, dose), ~ as_factor(.))

my_data %>% head()
```

<div data-pagedtable="false">
  <script data-pagedtable-source type="application/json">
{"columns":[{"label":[""],"name":["_rn_"],"type":[""],"align":["left"]},{"label":["len"],"name":[1],"type":["dbl"],"align":["right"]},{"label":["supp"],"name":[2],"type":["fctr"],"align":["left"]},{"label":["dose"],"name":[3],"type":["fctr"],"align":["left"]}],"data":[{"1":"4.2","2":"VC","3":"0.5","_rn_":"1"},{"1":"11.5","2":"VC","3":"0.5","_rn_":"2"},{"1":"7.3","2":"VC","3":"0.5","_rn_":"3"},{"1":"5.8","2":"VC","3":"0.5","_rn_":"4"},{"1":"6.4","2":"VC","3":"0.5","_rn_":"5"},{"1":"10.0","2":"VC","3":"0.5","_rn_":"6"}],"options":{"columns":{"min":{},"max":[10]},"rows":{"min":[10],"max":[10]},"pages":{}}}

  labs(title = "VC剂量和摄入方式对豚鼠牙齿的影响")
```

<img src="R4DS_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-431-1.png" width="576" />



问题：豚鼠牙齿的长度是否与药物的食用方法和剂量有关？

线性回归时，我们是通过独立变量来**预测**响应变量，但现在我们关注的重点会从预测**转向**不同组别差异之间的分析，这即为方差分析（ANOVA）。

这里是两个解释变量，所以问题需要双因素方差分析 (ANOVA)


```r
aov(len ~ supp + dose, data = my_data) %>%
  broom::tidy()
```

<div data-pagedtable="false">
  <script data-pagedtable-source type="application/json">
{"columns":[{"label":["term"],"name":[1],"type":["chr"],"align":["left"]},{"label":["df"],"name":[2],"type":["dbl"],"align":["right"]},{"label":["sumsq"],"name":[3],"type":["dbl"],"align":["right"]},{"label":["meansq"],"name":[4],"type":["dbl"],"align":["right"]},{"label":["statistic"],"name":[5],"type":["dbl"],"align":["right"]},{"label":["p.value"],"name":[6],"type":["dbl"],"align":["right"]}],"data":[{"1":"supp","2":"1","3":"205.4","4":"205.35","5":"14.02","6":"4.293e-04"},{"1":"dose","2":"2","3":"2426.4","4":"1213.22","5":"82.81","6":"1.871e-17"},{"1":"Residuals","2":"56","3":"820.4","4":"14.65","5":"NA","6":"NA"}],"options":{"columns":{"min":{},"max":[10]},"rows":{"min":[10],"max":[10]},"pages":{}}}
  </script>
</div>


检验表明不同类型之间存在显著差异，但是并没有告诉我们具体谁与谁之间的不同。需要多重比较帮助我们解决这个问题。使用`TurkeyHSD`函数


```r
aov(len ~ supp + dose, data = my_data) %>%
  TukeyHSD(which = "dose") %>%
  broom::tidy()
```

<div data-pagedtable="false">

思考：交互效应是否显著？

```r
aov(len ~ supp * dose, data = my_data) %>%
  broom::tidy()
```

<div data-pagedtable="false">
  <script data-pagedtable-source type="application/json">
{"columns":[{"label":["term"],"name":[1],"type":["chr"],"align":["left"]},{"label":["df"],"name":[2],"type":["dbl"],"align":["right"]},{"label":["sumsq"],"name":[3],"type":["dbl"],"align":["right"]},{"label":["meansq"],"name":[4],"type":["dbl"],"align":["right"]},{"label":["statistic"],"name":[5],"type":["dbl"],"align":["right"]},{"label":["p.value"],"name":[6],"type":["dbl"],"align":["right"]}],"data":[{"1":"supp","2":"1","3":"205.4","4":"205.35","5":"15.572","6":"2.312e-04"},{"1":"dose","2":"2","3":"2426.4","4":"1213.22","5":"92.000","6":"4.046e-18"},{"1":"supp:dose","2":"2","3":"108.3","4":"54.16","5":"4.107","6":"2.186e-02"},{"1":"Residuals","2":"54","3":"712.1","4":"13.19","5":"NA","6":"NA"}],"options":{"columns":{"min":{},"max":[10]},"rows":{"min":[10],"max":[10]},"pages":{}}}

# 线性回归 {#lm}

线性模型是数据分析中最常用的一种分析方法。最基础的往往最深刻。


```r
library(tidyverse)
```

## 从一个案例开始

这是一份1994年收集1379个对象关于收入、身高、教育水平等信息的数据集。数据在课件首页提供了下载链接。

首先，我们下载后导入数据

```r
wages <- read_csv("./demo_data/wages.csv")

wages %>% 
  head() 
```

<div data-pagedtable="false">
  <script data-pagedtable-source type="application/json">
{"columns":[{"label":["earn"],"name":[1],"type":["dbl"],"align":["right"]},{"label":["height"],"name":[2],"type":["dbl"],"align":["right"]},{"label":["sex"],"name":[3],"type":["chr"],"align":["left"]},{"label":["race"],"name":[4],"type":["chr"],"align":["left"]},{"label":["ed"],"name":[5],"type":["dbl"],"align":["right"]},{"label":["age"],"name":[6],"type":["dbl"],"align":["right"]}],"data":[{"1":"79571","2":"73.89","3":"male","4":"white","5":"16","6":"49"},{"1":"96397","2":"66.23","3":"female","4":"white","5":"16","6":"62"},{"1":"48711","2":"63.77","3":"female","4":"white","5":"16","6":"33"},{"1":"80478","2":"63.22","3":"female","4":"other","5":"16","6":"95"},{"1":"82089","2":"63.08","3":"female","4":"white","5":"17","6":"43"},{"1":"15313","2":"64.53","3":"female","4":"white","5":"15","6":"30"}],"options":{"columns":{"min":{},"max":[10]},"rows":{"min":[10],"max":[10]},"pages":{}}}
  </script>
</div>




### 缺失值检查

一般情况下，拿到一份数据，首先要了解数据，知道每个变量的含义，


```r
wages %>% colnames()
```

```
## [1] "earn"   "height" "sex"    "race"   "ed"    
## [6] "age"
```

同时检查数据是否有缺失值，这点很重要。在R中 NA（notavailable，不可用）表示缺失值, 比如可以这样检查是否有缺失值。



```r
# 如何检查数据是否有缺失值？
wages %>% 
  summarise(
     earn_na =  sum(is.na(earn)),
     height_na =  sum(is.na(height)),
     sex_na =  sum(is.na(sex)),
     race_na =  sum(is.na(race)),
     ed_na =  sum(is.na(ed)),
     age_na =  sum(is.na(age))
)
```

<div data-pagedtable="false">
  <script data-pagedtable-source type="application/json">
{"columns":[{"label":["earn_na"],"name":[1],"type":["int"],"align":["right"]},{"label":["height_na"],"name":[2],"type":["int"],"align":["right"]},{"label":["sex_na"],"name":[3],"type":["int"],"align":["right"]},{"label":["race_na"],"name":[4],"type":["int"],"align":["right"]},{"label":["ed_na"],"name":[5],"type":["int"],"align":["right"]},{"label":["age_na"],"name":[6],"type":["int"],"align":["right"]}],"data":[{"1":"0","2":"0","3":"0","4":"0","5":"0","6":"0"}],"options":{"columns":{"min":{},"max":[10]},"rows":{"min":[10],"max":[10]},"pages":{}}}
  </script>
</div>


程序员都是偷懒的，所以也可以写的简便一点。大家在学习的过程中，也会慢慢的发现tidyverse的函数很贴心，很周到。

```r
wages %>% 
  summarise_all(
     ~ sum(is.na(.))
)
```

<div data-pagedtable="false">
  <script data-pagedtable-source type="application/json">
{"columns":[{"label":["earn"],"name":[1],"type":["int"],"align":["right"]},{"label":["height"],"name":[2],"type":["int"],"align":["right"]},{"label":["sex"],"name":[3],"type":["int"],"align":["right"]},{"label":["race"],"name":[4],"type":["int"],"align":["right"]},{"label":["ed"],"name":[5],"type":["int"],"align":["right"]},{"label":["age"],"name":[6],"type":["int"],"align":["right"]}],"data":[{"1":"0","2":"0","3":"0","4":"0","5":"0","6":"0"}],"options":{"columns":{"min":{},"max":[10]},"rows":{"min":[10],"max":[10]},"pages":{}}}
  </script>
</div>

当然，也可以用`purrr::map()`的方法。这部分我会在后面的章节中逐步介绍。

```r
wages %>%
  map_df(~ sum(is.na(.)))
```

<div data-pagedtable="false">
  <script data-pagedtable-source type="application/json">
{"columns":[{"label":["earn"],"name":[1],"type":["int"],"align":["right"]},{"label":["height"],"name":[2],"type":["int"],"align":["right"]},{"label":["sex"],"name":[3],"type":["int"],"align":["right"]},{"label":["race"],"name":[4],"type":["int"],"align":["right"]},{"label":["ed"],"name":[5],"type":["int"],"align":["right"]},{"label":["age"],"name":[6],"type":["int"],"align":["right"]}],"data":[{"1":"0","2":"0","3":"0","4":"0","5":"0","6":"0"}],"options":{"columns":{"min":{},"max":[10]},"rows":{"min":[10],"max":[10]},"pages":{}}}
  </script>
</div>



###  变量简单统计

然后探索下每个变量的分布。比如调研数据中男女的数量分别是多少？

```r
wages %>% count(sex)
```

<div data-pagedtable="false">
  <script data-pagedtable-source type="application/json">
{"columns":[{"label":["sex"],"name":[1],"type":["chr"],"align":["left"]},{"label":["n"],"name":[2],"type":["int"],"align":["right"]}],"data":[{"1":"female","2":"859"},{"1":"male","2":"520"}],"options":{"columns":{"min":{},"max":[10]},"rows":{"min":[10],"max":[10]},"pages":{}}}
  </script>
</div>
男女这两组的身高均值分别是多少？收入的均值分别是多少？

```r
wages %>% 
  group_by(sex) %>% 
  summarise(
    n = n(),
    mean_height = mean(height),
    mean_earn = mean(earn)
  )
```

<div data-pagedtable="false">
  <script data-pagedtable-source type="application/json">
{"columns":[{"label":["sex"],"name":[1],"type":["chr"],"align":["left"]},{"label":["n"],"name":[2],"type":["int"],"align":["right"]},{"label":["mean_height"],"name":[3],"type":["dbl"],"align":["right"]},{"label":["mean_earn"],"name":[4],"type":["dbl"],"align":["right"]}],"data":[{"1":"female","2":"859","3":"64.50","4":"24246"},{"1":"male","2":"520","3":"70.04","4":"45993"}],"options":{"columns":{"min":{},"max":[10]},"rows":{"min":[10],"max":[10]},"pages":{}}}
  </script>
</div>

也有可以用可视化的方法，呈现男女收入的分布情况

```r
wages %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = earn, color = sex)) +
  geom_density()
```

<img src="R4DS_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-444-1.png" width="576" />

大家可以自行探索其他变量的情况。现在提出几个问题，希望大家带着这些问题去探索：

1. 长的越高的人挣钱越多？

2. 是否男性就比女性挣的多？

3. 影响收入最大的变量是哪个？
  
4. 怎么判定我们建立的模型是不是很好？



## 线性回归模型

**长的越高的人挣钱越多？**

要回答这个问题，我们先介绍线性模型。顾名思义，就是认为$x$和$y$之间有线性关系，数学上可以写为

$$
\begin{aligned}
y &= \alpha + \beta x + \epsilon \\
\epsilon &\in \text{Normal}(\mu, \sigma) 
\end{aligned}
$$

$ \epslion$ 代表误差项，它与$x$ 无关，且服从正态分布。
建立线性模型，就是要估计这里的系数$\hat\alpha$和$\hat\beta$，即截距项和斜率项。常用的方法是最小二乘法（ordinary least squares (OLS) regression）：
就是我们估算的$\hat\alpha$和$\hat\beta$, 要使得残差的平方和最小，即$\sum_i(y_i - \hat y_i)^2$或者叫$\sum_i \epsilon_i^2$最小。当然，数据量很大，手算是不现实的，我们借助R语言代码吧


## 使用`lm()` 函数

用R语言代码(建议大家先`?lm`看看帮助文档)，

`lm`参数很多, 但很多我们都用不上，所以我们只关注其中重要的两个参数


```r
lm(formula = y ~ x, data)
```

`lm(y ~ x, data)` 是最常用的线性模型函数(lm是linear model的缩写)。参数解释说明


<div class="danger">
<ul>
<li>formula：指定回归模型的公式，对于简单的线性回归模型<code>y ~ x</code>.</li>
<li>~ 符号：代表“预测”，可以读做“y由x预测”。有些学科不同的表述，比如下面都是可以的
<ul>
<li><code>response ~ explanatory</code><br />
</li>
<li><code>dependent ~ independent</code></li>
<li><code>outcome ~ predictors</code></li>
</ul></li>
<li>data：代表数据框，数据框包含了响应变量和独立变量</li>
</ul>
</div>



在运行`lm()`之前，先画出身高和收入的散点图(记在我们想干什么，寻找身高和收入的关系)


```r
wages %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = height, y = earn)) +
  geom_point()
```

<img src="R4DS_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-447-1.png" width="576" />


等不及了，就运行代码吧

```r
mod1 <- lm(formula = earn ~ height, 
          data = wages)
```


这里我们将`earn`作为响应变量，`height`为预测变量。`lm()`返回赋值给`mod1`. `mod1`现在是个什么东东呢？ mod1是一个叫`lm object`或者叫`类`的东西，


```r
names(mod1)
```

```
##  [1] "coefficients"  "residuals"     "effects"      
##  [4] "rank"          "fitted.values" "assign"       
##  [7] "qr"            "df.residual"   "xlevels"      
## [10] "call"          "terms"         "model"
```

我们打印看看，会发生什么


```r
print(mod1)
```

```
## 
## Call:
## lm(formula = earn ~ height, data = wages)
## 
## Coefficients:
## (Intercept)       height  
##     -126523         2387
```


这里有两部分信息。首先第一部分是我们建立的模型；第二部分是R给出了截距（$\alpha = -126532$）和斜率（$\beta = 2387$）. 也就是说我们建立的线性回归模型是
$$
\hat y = -126532 + 2387 \; x 
$$




<!-- tidyverse框架下，喜欢**数据框**的统计结果，因此，可用broom的`tidy()`函数将系数转换为数据框的形式 -->
<!-- ```{r} -->
<!-- broom::tidy(mod) -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- 也可以用broom的`glance()`函数**规整**模型的信息 -->
<!-- ```{r} -->
<!-- broom::glance(mod) -->
<!-- ``` -->

## 模型的解释

**建立一个`lm`模型是简单的，然而最重要的是，我们能解释这个模型。**

`mod1`的解释：

- 对于斜率$\beta = 2387$意味着，当一个人的身高是68英寸时，他的预期收入$earn = -126532 + 2387 \times 68= 35806$ 美元， 换个方式说，身高$height$每增加一个1英寸, 收入$earn$会增加2387美元。

- 对于截距$\alpha = -126532$，即当身高为0时，期望的收入值-126532。呵呵，人的身高不可能为0，所以这是一种极端的理论情况，现实不可能发生。



```r
wages %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = height, y = earn)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.25) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE)
```

<img src="R4DS_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-451-1.png" width="576" />



<!-- $$ -->
<!-- \begin{aligned} -->
<!-- y &= \alpha + \beta x + \epsilon \\ -->
<!-- \epsilon &\in \text{Normal}(\mu, \sigma)  -->
<!-- \end{aligned} -->
<!-- $$ -->


## 多元线性回归

刚才讨论的单个预测变量`height`，现在我们增加一个预测变量`ed`，稍微扩展一下我们的一元线性模型，就是多元回归模型

$$
\begin{aligned}
earn &= \alpha + \beta_1 \text{height} + \beta_2 \text{ed} +\epsilon \\
\end{aligned}
$$

R语言代码实现也很简单，只需要把变量`ed`增加在公式的右边

```r
mod2 <- lm(earn ~ height + ed, data = wages)
```
同样，我们打印`mod2`看看


```r
mod2
```

```
## 
## Call:
## lm(formula = earn ~ height + ed, data = wages)
## 
## Coefficients:
## (Intercept)       height           ed  
##     -161541         2087         4118
```

大家试着解释下`mod2`. 😄


## 更多模型


```r
lm(earn ~ sex, data = wages)
lm(earn ~ ed, data = wages)
lm(earn ~ age, data = wages)

lm(earn ~ height + sex, data = wages)
lm(earn ~ height + ed, data = wages)
lm(earn ~ height + age, data = wages)
lm(earn ~ height + race, data = wages)


lm(earn ~ height + sex + ed, data = wages)
lm(earn ~ height + sex + age, data = wages)
lm(earn ~ height + sex + race, data = wages)
lm(earn ~ height + ed + age, data = wages)
lm(earn ~ height + ed + race, data = wages)
lm(earn ~ height + age + race, data = wages)

lm(earn ~ height + sex + ed + age, data = wages)
lm(earn ~ height + sex + ed + race, data = wages)
lm(earn ~ height + sex + age + race, data = wages)
lm(earn ~ height + ed + age + race, data = wages)
lm(earn ~ sex + ed + age + race, data = wages)

lm(earn ~ height + sex + ed + age + race, data = wages)
```




## 可能遇到的情形

根据同学们的建议，模型中涉及统计知识，留给统计老师讲，我们这里是R语言课，应该讲代码。
因此，这里再介绍几种线性回归中遇到的几种特殊情况


### 截距项


```r
# 包含截距，以下两者是等价的
lm(earn ~ 1 + height, data = wages)
lm(earn ~ height, data = wages)

# 去掉截距，以下两者是等价的
lm(earn ~ height - 1, data = wages)
lm(earn ~ 0 + height, data = wages)
```


### 只有截距


```r
lm(earn ~ 1, data = wages)
```

```
## 
## Call:
## lm(formula = earn ~ 1, data = wages)
## 
## Coefficients:
## (Intercept)  
##       32446
```


```r
wages %>%
  summarise(
    mean_wages = mean(earn)
  )
```

<div data-pagedtable="false">
  <script data-pagedtable-source type="application/json">
{"columns":[{"label":["mean_wages"],"name":[1],"type":["dbl"],"align":["right"]}],"data":[{"1":"32446"}],"options":{"columns":{"min":{},"max":[10]},"rows":{"min":[10],"max":[10]},"pages":{}}}
  </script>
</div>


### 分类变量

race变量就是数据框wages的一个分类变量，代表四个不同的种族。用分类变量做回归，本质上是各组之间的进行比较。


```r
wages %>% distinct(race)
```

<div data-pagedtable="false">
  <script data-pagedtable-source type="application/json">
{"columns":[{"label":["race"],"name":[1],"type":["chr"],"align":["left"]}],"data":[{"1":"white"},{"1":"other"},{"1":"hispanic"},{"1":"black"}],"options":{"columns":{"min":{},"max":[10]},"rows":{"min":[10],"max":[10]},"pages":{}}}
  </script>
</div>



```r
wages %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = race, y = earn, fill = race)) + 
  geom_boxplot(position = position_dodge()) +
  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0, 20000))
```

<img src="R4DS_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-459-1.png" width="576" />

以分类变量作为解释变量，做线性回归


```r
mod3 <- lm(earn ~ race, data = wages)
mod3
```

```
## 
## Call:
## lm(formula = earn ~ race, data = wages)
## 
## Coefficients:
##  (Intercept)  racehispanic     raceother  
##        28372         -2887          3905  
##    racewhite  
##         4993
```

tidyverse框架下，喜欢**数据框**的统计结果，因此，可用broom的`tidy()`函数将**模型输出**转换为数据框的形式


```r
broom::tidy(mod3)
```

<div data-pagedtable="false">
  <script data-pagedtable-source type="application/json">
{"columns":[{"label":["term"],"name":[1],"type":["chr"],"align":["left"]},{"label":["estimate"],"name":[2],"type":["dbl"],"align":["right"]},{"label":["std.error"],"name":[3],"type":["dbl"],"align":["right"]},{"label":["statistic"],"name":[4],"type":["dbl"],"align":["right"]},{"label":["p.value"],"name":[5],"type":["dbl"],"align":["right"]}],"data":[{"1":"(Intercept)","2":"28372","3":"2781","4":"10.2036","5":"1.294e-23"},{"1":"racehispanic","2":"-2887","3":"4515","4":"-0.6394","5":"5.227e-01"},{"1":"raceother","2":"3905","3":"6428","4":"0.6075","5":"5.436e-01"},{"1":"racewhite","2":"4993","3":"2929","4":"1.7046","5":"8.850e-02"}],"options":{"columns":{"min":{},"max":[10]},"rows":{"min":[10],"max":[10]},"pages":{}}}
  </script>
</div>


我们看到输出结果，只有race_hispanic、 race_other和race_white三个系数和Intercept截距，race_black去哪里了呢？

事实上，race变量里有4组，回归时，选择black为**基线**，hispanic的系数，可以理解为由black**切换**到hispanic，引起earn收入的变化（效应）

-  对 black 组的估计，`earn = 28372.09 = 28372.09`
-  对 hispanic组的估计，`earn = 28372.09 + -2886.79 = 25485.30`
-  对 other 组的估计，`earn = 28372.09 + 3905.32 = 32277.41`
-  对 white 组的估计，`earn = 28372.09 + 4993.33 = 33365.42`

<!-- Linear regression with a categorical variable, is the equivalent -->
<!-- of ANOVA (Analysis of Variance) -->

<div class="danger">
<p>分类变量的线性回归本质上就是方差分析</p>
</div>
第 \@ref(tidystats) 章专题讨论方差分析


### 因子变量

hispanic组的估计最低，适合做基线，因此可以将race转换为因子变量，这样方便调整因子先后顺序

```r
wages_fct <- wages %>% 
  mutate(race = factor(race, levels = c("hispanic", "white", "black", "other"))) %>% 
  select(earn, race)

head(wages_fct)
```

<div data-pagedtable="false">
  <script data-pagedtable-source type="application/json">
{"columns":[{"label":["earn"],"name":[1],"type":["dbl"],"align":["right"]},{"label":["race"],"name":[2],"type":["fctr"],"align":["left"]}],"data":[{"1":"79571","2":"white"},{"1":"96397","2":"white"},{"1":"48711","2":"white"},{"1":"80478","2":"other"},{"1":"82089","2":"white"},{"1":"15313","2":"white"}],"options":{"columns":{"min":{},"max":[10]},"rows":{"min":[10],"max":[10]},"pages":{}}}
  </script>
</div>

`wages_fct`替换`wages`，然后建立线性模型

```r
mod4 <- lm(earn ~ race, data = wages_fct)
broom::tidy(mod4)
```

<div data-pagedtable="false">
  <script data-pagedtable-source type="application/json">
{"columns":[{"label":["term"],"name":[1],"type":["chr"],"align":["left"]},{"label":["estimate"],"name":[2],"type":["dbl"],"align":["right"]},{"label":["std.error"],"name":[3],"type":["dbl"],"align":["right"]},{"label":["statistic"],"name":[4],"type":["dbl"],"align":["right"]},{"label":["p.value"],"name":[5],"type":["dbl"],"align":["right"]}],"data":[{"1":"(Intercept)","2":"25485","3":"3557","4":"7.1649","5":"1.265e-12"},{"1":"racewhite","2":"7880","3":"3674","4":"2.1446","5":"3.216e-02"},{"1":"raceblack","2":"2887","3":"4515","4":"0.6394","5":"5.227e-01"},{"1":"raceother","2":"6792","3":"6800","4":"0.9988","5":"3.181e-01"}],"options":{"columns":{"min":{},"max":[10]},"rows":{"min":[10],"max":[10]},"pages":{}}}
  </script>
</div>

以hispanic组作为基线，各组系数也调整了，但加上截距后，实际值是没有变的。


大家可以用sex变量试试看

```r
lm(earn ~ sex, data = wages)
```



### 一个分类变量和一个连续变量

如果预测变量是一个分类变量和一个连续变量


```r
mod5 <- lm(earn ~ height + sex, data = wages)
coef(mod5)
```

```
## (Intercept)      height     sexmale 
##    -32479.9       879.4     16874.2
```

- `height = 879.424`  当sex保持不变时，height变化引起的earn变化
- `sexmale = 16874.158`  当height保持不变时，sex变化(female变为male)引起的earn变化



```r
wages %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = height, y = earn, color = sex)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.1) +
  geom_line(aes(y = predict(mod5))) +
  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0, 100000))
```

<img src="R4DS_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-467-1.png" width="576" />

### 偷懒的写法

. is shorthand for "everything else." 


```r
lm(earn ~ height + sex + race + ed + age, data = wages)
lm(earn ~ ., data = wages)

lm(earn ~ height + sex + race + ed, data = wages)
lm(earn ~ . - age, data = wages)
```

R 语言很多时候都出现了`.`，不同的场景，含义是不一样的。我会在后面第 \@ref(dot) 章专门讨论这个问题， 这是一个非常重要的问题


### 交互项


```r
lm(earn ~ height + sex + height:sex, data = wages)
lm(earn ~ height * sex, data = wages)
lm(earn ~ (height + sex)^2, data = wages)
```


```r
lm(earn ~ height:sex, data = wages)
lm(earn ~ height:sex:race, data = wages)
```



```r
mod6 <- lm(earn ~ height + sex + height:sex, data = wages)
coef(mod6)
```

```
##    (Intercept)         height        sexmale 
##       -12167.0          564.5       -30510.4 
## height:sexmale 
##          701.4
```

<!-- - For men, a 1" increase in height is associated with a gain in earnings of 1265.92 -->
<!-- - For women, a 1" increase in height is associated with a gain in earnings of1265.92 + (-701.41) = 564.51 -->

- 对于女性，height增长1个单位，引起earn的增长`564.5102`
- 对于男性，height增长1个单位，引起earn的增长`564.5102 + 701.4065 = 1265.92` 



```r
wages %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = height, y = earn, color = sex)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.1) +
  geom_line(aes(y = predict(mod6))) +
  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0, 100000))
```

<img src="R4DS_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-472-1.png" width="576" />

### predict vs fit

- fitted() , 模型一旦建立，可以使用拟合函数`fitted()`返回拟合值，建模和拟合使用的是同一数据
- predict()， 模型建立后，可以用新的数据进行预测，`predict()`要求数据框包含新的预测变量，如果没有提供，那么就使用建模时的预测变量进行预测，这种情况下，得出的结果和`fitted()`就时一回事了。


`predict()`函数和`fitted()`函数不同的地方，还在于`predict()`函数往往带有返回何种类型的选项，可以是具体数值，也可以是分类变量。具体会在第 \@ref(tidymodels) 章介绍。

### 回归和相关的关系

- 相关，比如求两个变量的相关系数`cor(x, y)`
- 回归，也是探寻自变量和因变量的关系，一般用来**预测**

回归分析中，如果自变量只有一个$x$，也就是模型`lm(y~x)`，那么回归和相关就有关联了。


比如：计算身高和收入两者的Pearson相关系数的平方

```r
r <- cor(wages$height, wages$earn)  
print( r^2 ) 
```

```
## [1] 0.08503
```


然后看看，身高和收入的线性模型


```r
lm(formula = earn ~ height, data = wages) %>% 
  broom::glance() %>% 
  pull(r.squared)
```

```
## [1] 0.08503
```
相关系数的平方 和 线性模型的$R^2$是相等的

线性回归需要满足四个前提假设：

1. **Linearity **
    - 因变量和每个自变量都是线性关系

2. **Indpendence **
    - 对于所有的观测值，它们的误差项相互之间是独立的

3. **Normality **
    - 误差项服从正态分布

4. **Equal-variance **  
    - [所有的误差项具有同样方差](<https://www.zhihu.com/question/67473778>)

这四个假设的首字母，合起来就是\alert{LINE}，这样很好记

##  From gather to pivot

Easily Tidy Data

<img src="images/import_datatype01.png" width="45%" style="display: block; margin: auto auto auto 0;" />


- Each variable is a column
- Each observation is a row
- Each type of observational unit is a table



从2019年9月份，[tidyr](<https://tidyr.tidyverse.org/>) 1.0.0新增了一组函数`pivot_longer()/pivot_wider()`，用来补充原来的`gather()/spread()` 


* `gather()/pivot_longer `  it makes “wide” data longer.
* `spread()/pivot_wider`  it makes “long” data wider.




```r
fake_data <- data.frame(
  id = 1:20,
  variable1 = runif(20, 0, 1),
  variable2 = rnorm(20)
)
```



```r
melted <- gather(fake_data, variable, value, 2:3)

## Column names instead of indices
melted <- gather(fake_data, variable, value, variable1, variable2)

## Excluding instead of including
melted <- gather(fake_data, variable, value, -1)

## Excluding using column name
melted <- gather(fake_data, variable, value, -id)
```



现在推荐大家，使用`pivot_longer()`函数

```r
long <- pivot_longer(fake_data, 2:3,
  names_to = "variable",
  values_to = "value"
)
long
```

## scoped 函数

在第 \@ref(dplyr) 章介绍了dplyr的一些函数（`mutate()`, `select()`等等），事实上，这些函数加上后缀
`_all, _at, _if`，形成三组变体函数，可以方便对**特定的子集**进行操作。比如

- 对数据框所有列操作，可以用`_all`
- 对数据框指定的几列操作，可以用`_at`
- 对数据框符合条件的几列进行操作，可以用`_if`

| Operate   | _all          | _at          | _if          |
|-----------|---------------|--------------|--------------|
| `select()`    | `select_all()`    | `select_at()`    | `select_if()`    |
| `mutate()`    | `mutate_all()`    | `mutate_at()`    | `mutate_if()`    |
| `rename()`    | `rename_all()`    | `rename_at()`    | `rename_if()`    |
| `arrange()`   | `arrange_all()`   | `arrange_at()`   | `arrange_if()`   |
| `filter()`    | `filter_all()`    | `filter_at()`    | `filter_if()`    |
| `distinct()`  | `distinct_all()`  | `distinct_at()`  | `distinct_if()`  |
| `group_by()`  | `group_by_all()`  | `group_by_at()`  | `group_by_if()`  |
| `summarise()` | `summarise_all()` | `summarise_at()` | `summarise_if()` |
| `map()`       | `map_all()`       | `map_at()`       | `map_if()`       |
| `modify()`    | `modify_all()`    | `modify_at()`    | `modify_if()`    |

`filter_if()`配合`all_vars(), any_vars()`函数，可以完成很酷的工作.
比如，要求一行中所有变量的值都大于150

```r
mtcars %>% filter_all(all_vars(. > 150))
```

<div data-pagedtable="false">
  <script data-pagedtable-source type="application/json">

`filter_if(.tbl, .predicate, .vars_predicate)` 相对复杂点，我这里多说几句。

filter_if() 有三个参数：

- .tbl, 数据框
- .predicate, 应用在列上的函数，一般作为列的选择条件
- .vars_predicate, 应用在一行上的函数，通过 `all_vars(), any_vars()`返回值决定是否选取该行。



```r
# And filter_if() selects variables with a predicate function:
# filter_if(.tbl, .predicate, .vars_predicate)
# mtcars %>% map_df(~ all(floor(.) == .) )
# mtcars %>% select_if( ~ all(floor(.) == .) )

mtcars %>% filter_if(~ all(floor(.) == .), all_vars(. != 0))
```

所以这里是，先通过`.predicate = ~ all(floor(.) == .)` 选取变量值为整数的列，然后再看选取的这些列的行方向，如果每一行的值`.vars_predicate = all_vars(. != 0)` ，都不为0，就保留下来，否则过滤掉。

简单点说，这段代码的意思，**数值全部为整数的列，不能同时为0**






## group_by

`group_by()` 用的很多，所以要多讲讲


```r
mtcars %>% group_by(cyl)
```

如果使用`group_split()`, 注意分组后，返回的是列表

```r
iris %>%
  group_split(Species)
```

```

既然是列表，当然想到用前面讲到的`purrr::map()`家族

```r
iris %>%
  group_split(Species) %>%
  map(~ broom::tidy(lm(Petal.Length ~ Sepal.Length, data = .x)))
```

```
## [[1]]

```





```r
iris %>%
  group_split(Species) %>%
  map_df(~ broom::tidy(lm(Petal.Length ~ Sepal.Length, data = .x)))
```

<div data-pagedtable="false">
  <script data-pagedtable-source type="application/json">

上面这个代码，数据框分割成list, 处理完后再合并成数据框，难道不觉得折腾么？ 为什么直接点？
tidyverse不会让我们失望的，先看看`group_map()`

```r
## The result of .f should be a data frame(.f 必须返回数据框)
## `group_map()` return a list of tibble(返回元素均为df的一个列表list(df1,df2,df3))
iris %>%
  group_by(Species) %>%
  group_map(~ broom::tidy(lm(Petal.Length ~ Sepal.Length, data = .x)))
```

```
## [[1]]
## # A tibble: 2 x 5
##   term         estimate std.error statistic p.value
##   <chr>           <dbl>     <dbl>     <dbl>   <dbl>
## 1 (Intercept)     0.803    0.344       2.34  0.0238
## 2 Sepal.Length    0.132    0.0685      1.92  0.0607
## 
## [[2]]
## # A tibble: 2 x 5
##   term         estimate std.error statistic  p.value
##   <chr>           <dbl>     <dbl>     <dbl>    <dbl>
## 1 (Intercept)     0.185    0.514      0.360 7.20e- 1
## 2 Sepal.Length    0.686    0.0863     7.95  2.59e-10
## 
## [[3]]
## # A tibble: 2 x 5
##   term         estimate std.error statistic  p.value
##   <chr>           <dbl>     <dbl>     <dbl>    <dbl>
## 1 (Intercept)     0.610    0.417       1.46 1.50e- 1
## 2 Sepal.Length    0.750    0.0630     11.9  6.30e-16
```

数据框进来，然后分组，依次处理成一个个数据框，最后以列表形式（a list of tibble）输出。



`group_modify()` 才是真正意义上的"数据框进、数据框出"。


```r
iris %>%
  group_by(Species) %>%
  group_modify(~ broom::tidy(lm(Petal.Length ~ Sepal.Length, data = .x)))
```

<div data-pagedtable="false">
  <script data-pagedtable-source type="application/json">
{"columns":[{"label":["Species"],"name":[1],"type":["fctr"],"align":["left"]},{"label":["term"],"name":[2],"type":["chr"],"align":["left"]},{"label":["estimate"],"name":[3],"type":["dbl"],"align":["right"]},{"label":["std.error"],"name":[4],"type":["dbl"],"align":["right"]},{"label":["statistic"],"name":[5],"type":["dbl"],"align":["right"]},{"label":["p.value"],"name":[6],"type":["dbl"],"align":["right"]}],"data":[{"1":"setosa","2":"(Intercept)","3":"0.8031","4":"0.34388","5":"2.335","6":"2.376e-02"},{"1":"setosa","2":"Sepal.Length","3":"0.1316","4":"0.06853","5":"1.921","6":"6.070e-02"},{"1":"versicolor","2":"(Intercept)","3":"0.1851","4":"0.51421","5":"0.360","6":"7.204e-01"},{"1":"versicolor","2":"Sepal.Length","3":"0.6865","4":"0.08631","5":"7.954","6":"2.586e-10"},{"1":"virginica","2":"(Intercept)","3":"0.6105","4":"0.41711","5":"1.464","6":"1.498e-01"},{"1":"virginica","2":"Sepal.Length","3":"0.7501","4":"0.06303","5":"11.901","6":"6.298e-16"}],"options":{"columns":{"min":{},"max":[10]},"rows":{"min":[10],"max":[10]},"pages":{}}}

为了大家方便查阅和记忆，我总结下表



| 函数 | 说明 | 常用组合 | 返回值 | 要求 |
|----------|-------------|-------------------|------------------|---------|
| map() | 列表进、列表出 | df %>% <br>group_split() %>% <br>map() | list |  |
| map_df() | 列表进、数据框出 | df %>% <br>group_split() %>% <br>map_df() | df |  |
| group_map() | 数据框进、列表出 | df %>% <br>group_by() %>% <br>group_map() | 返回list(df1, df2, ...) | .f返回df |
| group_modify() | 数据框进、数据框出 | df %>% <br>group_by() %>% <br>group_modify() | 返回grouped tibble | .f返回df |
|  |  |  |  |  |
| walk | 列表进 | df %>% <br>group_split() %>%<br>walk() | side effects |  |
| group_walk() | 数据框进 | df %>% <br>group_by() %>% <br>group_walk() | side effects |  |



### 其他group函数
group_nest(), group_data(), group_keys(), group_rows()





## 列名清理


数据框的列名，不要用有空格和中文。
如果拿到的原始数据中列比较多，手动修改麻烦，可以使用`janitor::clean_names()`函数

```r
library(readxl)
library(janitor) # install.packages("janitor")

roster_raw <- read_excel(here::here("demo_data", "dirty_data.xlsx"))

glimpse(roster_raw)
```

```

如果所有的列，都是数值型


```r
func <- function(x) (x - min(x)) / (max(x) - min(x))

df_mtcars %>% mutate_all(~ func(.))
```

```
## Error in x - min(x): 二进列运算符中有非数值参数
```

-  但这里数据中还有其他类型（fct, chr），所以这里 `mutate_all()` 会报错。
-  这种情形，用`mutate_if()`





```r
func <- function(x) (x - min(x)) / (max(x) - min(x))

df_mtcars %>% mutate_if(is.numeric, ~ func(.))
```

# tidyverse中行方向的操作 {#rowwise}



```r
library(tidyverse)
```

tidyverse 喜欢数据框，因为一列就是一个向量，一列一列的处理起来很方便。然而我们有时候也要，完成行方向的操作，所以有必要介绍tidyverse中行方向的处理机制。

## 问题


```r
df <- tibble(x = 1:3, y = 4:6)
df
```

对每行的求和、求均值、最小值或者最大值？


## rowwise函数

dplyr提供了rowwise函数，但大神说不推荐

```r
df %>% 
  rowwise() %>% 
  mutate( i = sum(x, y) )
```

<div data-pagedtable="false">
  <script data-pagedtable-source type="application/json">
{"columns":[{"label":["x"],"name":[1],"type":["int"],"align":["right"]},{"label":["y"],"name":[2],"type":["int"],"align":["right"]},{"label":["i"],"name":[3],"type":["int"],"align":["right"]}],"data":[{"1":"1","2":"4","3":"5"},{"1":"2","2":"5","3":"7"},{"1":"3","2":"6","3":"9"}],"options":{"columns":{"min":{},"max":[10]},"rows":{"min":[10],"max":[10]},"pages":{}}}
  </script>
</div>



```r
df %>% 
  rowwise() %>% 
  mutate( i = mean(c(x, y) ))
```

<div data-pagedtable="false">
  <script data-pagedtable-source type="application/json">
{"columns":[{"label":["x"],"name":[1],"type":["int"],"align":["right"]},{"label":["y"],"name":[2],"type":["int"],"align":["right"]},{"label":["i"],"name":[3],"type":["dbl"],"align":["right"]}],"data":[{"1":"1","2":"4","3":"2.5"},{"1":"2","2":"5","3":"3.5"},{"1":"3","2":"6","3":"4.5"}],"options":{"columns":{"min":{},"max":[10]},"rows":{"min":[10],"max":[10]},"pages":{}}}
  </script>
</div>


```r
df %>%
  rowwise() %>% 
  mutate(min = min(x,y),
         max = max(x,y)
         )
```

<div data-pagedtable="false">
  <script data-pagedtable-source type="application/json">
{"columns":[{"label":["x"],"name":[1],"type":["int"],"align":["right"]},{"label":["y"],"name":[2],"type":["int"],"align":["right"]},{"label":["min"],"name":[3],"type":["int"],"align":["right"]},{"label":["max"],"name":[4],"type":["int"],"align":["right"]}],"data":[{"1":"1","2":"4","3":"1","4":"4"},{"1":"2","2":"5","3":"2","4":"5"},{"1":"3","2":"6","3":"3","4":"6"}],"options":{"columns":{"min":{},"max":[10]},"rows":{"min":[10],"max":[10]},"pages":{}}}
  </script>
</div>



```r
df %>% 
  rowwise() %>% 
  do(i = mean(c(.$x, .$y))) %>% 
  unnest(i)
```

<div data-pagedtable="false">
  <script data-pagedtable-source type="application/json">

  </script>
</div>

## Row-wise Summaries

```r
df %>% mutate(row_sum = rowSums(.[1:2])  )
```

<div data-pagedtable="false">
  <script data-pagedtable-source type="application/json">
{"columns":[{"label":["x"],"name":[1],"type":["int"],"align":["right"]},{"label":["y"],"name":[2],"type":["int"],"align":["right"]},{"label":["row_sum"],"name":[3],"type":["dbl"],"align":["right"]}],"data":[{"1":"1","2":"4","3":"5"},{"1":"2","2":"5","3":"7"},{"1":"3","2":"6","3":"9"}],"options":{"columns":{"min":{},"max":[10]},"rows":{"min":[10],"max":[10]},"pages":{}}}
  </script>
</div>



```r
df %>% mutate(row_mean = rowMeans(.[1:2])  ) 
```

<div data-pagedtable="false">
  <script data-pagedtable-source type="application/json">
{"columns":[{"label":["x"],"name":[1],"type":["int"],"align":["right"]},{"label":["y"],"name":[2],"type":["int"],"align":["right"]},{"label":["row_mean"],"name":[3],"type":["dbl"],"align":["right"]}],"data":[{"1":"1","2":"4","3":"2.5"},{"1":"2","2":"5","3":"3.5"},{"1":"3","2":"6","3":"4.5"}],"options":{"columns":{"min":{},"max":[10]},"rows":{"min":[10],"max":[10]},"pages":{}}}
  </script>
</div>


```r
df %>% mutate(t_sum = rowSums(select_if(., is.numeric)))
```

<div data-pagedtable="false">
  <script data-pagedtable-source type="application/json">
{"columns":[{"label":["x"],"name":[1],"type":["int"],"align":["right"]},{"label":["y"],"name":[2],"type":["int"],"align":["right"]},{"label":["t_sum"],"name":[3],"type":["dbl"],"align":["right"]}],"data":[{"1":"1","2":"4","3":"5"},{"1":"2","2":"5","3":"7"},{"1":"3","2":"6","3":"9"}],"options":{"columns":{"min":{},"max":[10]},"rows":{"min":[10],"max":[10]},"pages":{}}}
  </script>
</div>

固然可解决问题， 然而，却不是一个很好的办法，比如除了求和与计算均值，可能还要计算每行的中位数、方差等等， 因为，不是每种计算都对应的row_函数？ 既然是tidyverse ，还是用tidyverse 的方法解决


## purrr::map方案

按照Jenny Bryan的方案


```r
df %>% mutate(t_sum = pmap_dbl(list(x, y), sum))
```

<div data-pagedtable="false">
  <script data-pagedtable-source type="application/json">
{"columns":[{"label":["x"],"name":[1],"type":["int"],"align":["right"]},{"label":["y"],"name":[2],"type":["int"],"align":["right"]},{"label":["t_sum"],"name":[3],"type":["dbl"],"align":["right"]}],"data":[{"1":"1","2":"4","3":"5"},{"1":"2","2":"5","3":"7"},{"1":"3","2":"6","3":"9"}],"options":{"columns":{"min":{},"max":[10]},"rows":{"min":[10],"max":[10]},"pages":{}}}
  </script>
</div>



```r
df %>%
	mutate(t_sum = pmap_dbl(select_if(., is.numeric), sum))
```

<div data-pagedtable="false">
  <script data-pagedtable-source type="application/json">
{"columns":[{"label":["x"],"name":[1],"type":["int"],"align":["right"]},{"label":["y"],"name":[2],"type":["int"],"align":["right"]},{"label":["t_sum"],"name":[3],"type":["dbl"],"align":["right"]}],"data":[{"1":"1","2":"4","3":"5"},{"1":"2","2":"5","3":"7"},{"1":"3","2":"6","3":"9"}],"options":{"columns":{"min":{},"max":[10]},"rows":{"min":[10],"max":[10]},"pages":{}}}
  </script>
</div>

计算均值的时候， 然而报错了

```r
df %>% mutate(t_sum = pmap_dbl(select_if(., is.numeric), mean))
```

tidyverse 总会想出办法来解决，把`mean()` 变成 `lift_vd(mean)`


```r
df %>%
	mutate(data = pmap_dbl(select_if(., is.numeric), lift_vd(mean)))
```

<div data-pagedtable="false">
  <script data-pagedtable-source type="application/json">
{"columns":[{"label":["x"],"name":[1],"type":["int"],"align":["right"]},{"label":["y"],"name":[2],"type":["int"],"align":["right"]},{"label":["data"],"name":[3],"type":["dbl"],"align":["right"]}],"data":[{"1":"1","2":"4","3":"2.5"},{"1":"2","2":"5","3":"3.5"},{"1":"3","2":"6","3":"4.5"}],"options":{"columns":{"min":{},"max":[10]},"rows":{"min":[10],"max":[10]},"pages":{}}}
  </script>
</div>


同理

```r
df %>% mutate(t_median = pmap_dbl(select_if(., is.numeric), lift_vd(median)))
```

<div data-pagedtable="false">
  <script data-pagedtable-source type="application/json">
{"columns":[{"label":["x"],"name":[1],"type":["int"],"align":["right"]},{"label":["y"],"name":[2],"type":["int"],"align":["right"]},{"label":["t_median"],"name":[3],"type":["dbl"],"align":["right"]}],"data":[{"1":"1","2":"4","3":"2.5"},{"1":"2","2":"5","3":"3.5"},{"1":"3","2":"6","3":"4.5"}],"options":{"columns":{"min":{},"max":[10]},"rows":{"min":[10],"max":[10]},"pages":{}}}
  </script>
</div>



```r
df %>% mutate(t_sd = pmap_dbl(select_if(., is.numeric), lift_vd(sd)))
```

<div data-pagedtable="false">
  <script data-pagedtable-source type="application/json">
{"columns":[{"label":["x"],"name":[1],"type":["int"],"align":["right"]},{"label":["y"],"name":[2],"type":["int"],"align":["right"]},{"label":["t_sd"],"name":[3],"type":["dbl"],"align":["right"]}],"data":[{"1":"1","2":"4","3":"2.121"},{"1":"2","2":"5","3":"2.121"},{"1":"3","2":"6","3":"2.121"}],"options":{"columns":{"min":{},"max":[10]},"rows":{"min":[10],"max":[10]},"pages":{}}}
  </script>
</div>





## tidy 的方案

我个人推荐的方法(Gather, group, summarize, left_join)


```r
new_df <- df %>%
  mutate(id = row_number()) 

s <- new_df %>% 
  gather("time", "val", -id) %>%
  group_by(id) %>%
  summarize(
    t_avg = mean(val),
    t_sum = sum(val)
  )

s
```

<div data-pagedtable="false">
  <script data-pagedtable-source type="application/json">
{"columns":[{"label":["id"],"name":[1],"type":["int"],"align":["right"]},{"label":["t_avg"],"name":[2],"type":["dbl"],"align":["right"]},{"label":["t_sum"],"name":[3],"type":["int"],"align":["right"]}],"data":[{"1":"1","2":"2.5","3":"5"},{"1":"2","2":"3.5","3":"7"},{"1":"3","2":"4.5","3":"9"}],"options":{"columns":{"min":{},"max":[10]},"rows":{"min":[10],"max":[10]},"pages":{}}}
  </script>
</div>


```r
new_df %>%
  left_join(s)
```

<div data-pagedtable="false">
  <script data-pagedtable-source type="application/json">
{"columns":[{"label":["x"],"name":[1],"type":["int"],"align":["right"]},{"label":["y"],"name":[2],"type":["int"],"align":["right"]},{"label":["id"],"name":[3],"type":["int"],"align":["right"]},{"label":["t_avg"],"name":[4],"type":["dbl"],"align":["right"]},{"label":["t_sum"],"name":[5],"type":["int"],"align":["right"]}],"data":[{"1":"1","2":"4","3":"1","4":"2.5","5":"5"},{"1":"2","2":"5","3":"2","4":"3.5","5":"7"},{"1":"3","2":"6","3":"3","4":"4.5","5":"9"}],"options":{"columns":{"min":{},"max":[10]},"rows":{"min":[10],"max":[10]},"pages":{}}}
  </script>
</div>

有点繁琐，但思路清晰


```r
ss <- new_df %>%
  group_by(id) %>%
  summarise(t_avg = mean(c(x, y)) )

ss
```

<div data-pagedtable="false">
  <script data-pagedtable-source type="application/json">
{"columns":[{"label":["id"],"name":[1],"type":["int"],"align":["right"]},{"label":["t_avg"],"name":[2],"type":["dbl"],"align":["right"]}],"data":[{"1":"1","2":"2.5"},{"1":"2","2":"3.5"},{"1":"3","2":"4.5"}],"options":{"columns":{"min":{},"max":[10]},"rows":{"min":[10],"max":[10]},"pages":{}}}
  </script>
</div>



```r
new_df %>%
  left_join(ss)
```

<div data-pagedtable="false">
  <script data-pagedtable-source type="application/json">
{"columns":[{"label":["x"],"name":[1],"type":["int"],"align":["right"]},{"label":["y"],"name":[2],"type":["int"],"align":["right"]},{"label":["id"],"name":[3],"type":["int"],"align":["right"]},{"label":["t_avg"],"name":[4],"type":["dbl"],"align":["right"]}],"data":[{"1":"1","2":"4","3":"1","4":"2.5"},{"1":"2","2":"5","3":"2","4":"3.5"},{"1":"3","2":"6","3":"3","4":"4.5"}],"options":{"columns":{"min":{},"max":[10]},"rows":{"min":[10],"max":[10]},"pages":{}}}
  </script>
</div>


之所以有这么多的搞法，是因为没有一个很好的搞法




## slide方案

[slide](https://github.com/DavisVaughan/slide)很强大，可以滚动喔


- 如果第一个参数是数据框，`slide`把数据框看作a vector of rows， 然后行方向的滚动，事实上， .x是一个个的小数据框（如下）
- 与`purrr::map`不同，因为map把数据框看作列方向的向量， 然后迭代
- 如果第一个参数是原子型向量的话，还是依次迭代逗号分隔的元素，只不过这里是slide比map更强大的是，还可以是滚动


```r
library(slide)

df <- tibble(a = 1:3, b = 4:6)

slide(
  select_if(df, is.numeric), 
  ~.x, 
  .before = 1
)
```

```
## [[1]]
## # A tibble: 1 x 2
##       a     b
##   <int> <int>
## 1     1     4
## 
## [[2]]
## # A tibble: 2 x 2
##       a     b
##   <int> <int>
## 1     1     4
## 2     2     5
## 
## [[3]]
## # A tibble: 2 x 2
##       a     b
##   <int> <int>
## 1     2     5
## 2     3     6
```




```r
df %>% 
  mutate(
    r_mean = slide_dbl(
      select_if(df, is.numeric), 
      ~mean(unlist(.x)), 
      .before = 1
    )
  )
```

<div data-pagedtable="false">
  <script data-pagedtable-source type="application/json">
{"columns":[{"label":["a"],"name":[1],"type":["int"],"align":["right"]},{"label":["b"],"name":[2],"type":["int"],"align":["right"]},{"label":["r_mean"],"name":[3],"type":["dbl"],"align":["right"]}],"data":[{"1":"1","2":"4","3":"2.5"},{"1":"2","2":"5","3":"3.0"},{"1":"3","2":"6","3":"4.0"}],"options":{"columns":{"min":{},"max":[10]},"rows":{"min":[10],"max":[10]},"pages":{}}}
  </script>

# tidyverse中的dot {#dot}

本章介绍tidyverse的语法中经常遇到`.`， 不同的场景，含义不同。因此很有必要弄清楚各自的含义。


```r
library(tidyverse)
```


## 每一行的 `.` 各自代表什么意思呢?


```r
read_csv("./data/wages.csv") %>%
  mutate(letter = str_extract(race, "(?<=h)(.)")) %>%
  select(., -letter) %>%
  mutate_at(vars(race), ~ as.factor(.)) %>%
  mutate_at(vars(sex), ~ if_else(. == "male", 1, 0)) %>%
  filter_if(~ is.numeric(.), all_vars(. != 0)) %>% 
  split(.$sex) %>%
  map(~ lm(earn ~ ., data = .)) %>%
  map_dfr(~ broom::tidy(.), .id = "sex")
```

回答之前，我们先介绍一些相关知识点

## 占位符

管道符号` %>%` 主要功能是传递参数。

- `y %>% f()` is equivalent to `f(y)` 

- `y %>% f(x, .)` is equivalent to `f(x, y)` 
 
- `z %>% f(x, y, arg = .)` is equivalent to `f(x, y, arg  = z)`

我们经常这样写

```r
mtcars %>% 
  select(cyl, disp, hp) %>% 
  head(2)
```

<div data-pagedtable="false">
  <script data-pagedtable-source type="application/json">
{"columns":[{"label":[""],"name":["_rn_"],"type":[""],"align":["left"]},{"label":["cyl"],"name":[1],"type":["dbl"],"align":["right"]},{"label":["disp"],"name":[2],"type":["dbl"],"align":["right"]},{"label":["hp"],"name":[3],"type":["dbl"],"align":["right"]}],"data":[{"1":"6","2":"160","3":"110","_rn_":"Mazda RX4"},{"1":"6","2":"160","3":"110","_rn_":"Mazda RX4 Wag"}],"options":{"columns":{"min":{},"max":[10]},"rows":{"min":[10],"max":[10]},"pages":{}}}
  </script>
</div>

实际上，这里是有占位符的

```r
mtcars %>% 
  select(., cyl, disp, hp) %>% 
  head(., 2)
```

<div data-pagedtable="false">
  <script data-pagedtable-source type="application/json">
{"columns":[{"label":[""],"name":["_rn_"],"type":[""],"align":["left"]},{"label":["cyl"],"name":[1],"type":["dbl"],"align":["right"]},{"label":["disp"],"name":[2],"type":["dbl"],"align":["right"]},{"label":["hp"],"name":[3],"type":["dbl"],"align":["right"]}],"data":[{"1":"6","2":"160","3":"110","_rn_":"Mazda RX4"},{"1":"6","2":"160","3":"110","_rn_":"Mazda RX4 Wag"}],"options":{"columns":{"min":{},"max":[10]},"rows":{"min":[10],"max":[10]},"pages":{}}}
  </script>
</div>

## Lambda函数

`.`出现在函数`.f`的位置上， 就是 purrr 风格的Lambda函数`~ fun(.)`， 

```r
mtcars %>% 
  select_at(vars(contains("ar")), ~toupper(.)) %>% 
  head(3)
```

<div data-pagedtable="false">
  <script data-pagedtable-source type="application/json">
{"columns":[{"label":[""],"name":["_rn_"],"type":[""],"align":["left"]},{"label":["GEAR"],"name":[1],"type":["dbl"],"align":["right"]},{"label":["CARB"],"name":[2],"type":["dbl"],"align":["right"]}],"data":[{"1":"4","2":"4","_rn_":"Mazda RX4"},{"1":"4","2":"4","_rn_":"Mazda RX4 Wag"},{"1":"4","2":"1","_rn_":"Datsun 710"}],"options":{"columns":{"min":{},"max":[10]},"rows":{"min":[10],"max":[10]},"pages":{}}}
  </script>
</div>

有时候程序员会将`~toupper(.) `简写成 `toupper`

```r
mtcars %>% 
  select_at(vars(contains("ar")), toupper) %>% 
  head(3)
```

<div data-pagedtable="false">
  <script data-pagedtable-source type="application/json">
{"columns":[{"label":[""],"name":["_rn_"],"type":[""],"align":["left"]},{"label":["GEAR"],"name":[1],"type":["dbl"],"align":["right"]},{"label":["CARB"],"name":[2],"type":["dbl"],"align":["right"]}],"data":[{"1":"4","2":"4","_rn_":"Mazda RX4"},{"1":"4","2":"4","_rn_":"Mazda RX4 Wag"},{"1":"4","2":"1","_rn_":"Datsun 710"}],"options":{"columns":{"min":{},"max":[10]},"rows":{"min":[10],"max":[10]},"pages":{}}}
  </script>
</div>


## 正则表达式


```r
words <- "the fattest cat."
```



```r
words %>% str_replace_all("t.", "-")
```

```
## [1] "-e fa-es-ca-"
```



```r
words %>% str_replace_all("t\\.", "-")
```

```
## [1] "the fattest ca-"
```


## Unary funciton (只带一个参数的函数)
<!-- A pipeline with a dot (.) as LHS will create a unary function. -->


```r
mean_rm <- . %>% mean(na.rm = T)

c(1, 2, 3, NA) %>% mean_rm
```

```
## [1] 2
```

等价于

```r
# is equivalent to
c(1, 2, 3, NA) %>% mean(., na.rm = T)
```

```
## [1] 2
```


## more placeholder




```r
iris %>% subset(1:nrow(.) %% 30 == 0)
```

<div data-pagedtable="false">
  <script data-pagedtable-source type="application/json">
{"columns":[{"label":[""],"name":["_rn_"],"type":[""],"align":["left"]},{"label":["Sepal.Length"],"name":[1],"type":["dbl"],"align":["right"]},{"label":["Sepal.Width"],"name":[2],"type":["dbl"],"align":["right"]},{"label":["Petal.Length"],"name":[3],"type":["dbl"],"align":["right"]},{"label":["Petal.Width"],"name":[4],"type":["dbl"],"align":["right"]},{"label":["Species"],"name":[5],"type":["fctr"],"align":["left"]}],"data":[{"1":"4.7","2":"3.2","3":"1.6","4":"0.2","5":"setosa","_rn_":"30"},{"1":"5.2","2":"2.7","3":"3.9","4":"1.4","5":"versicolor","_rn_":"60"},{"1":"5.5","2":"2.5","3":"4.0","4":"1.3","5":"versicolor","_rn_":"90"},{"1":"6.0","2":"2.2","3":"5.0","4":"1.5","5":"virginica","_rn_":"120"},{"1":"5.9","2":"3.0","3":"5.1","4":"1.8","5":"virginica","_rn_":"150"}],"options":{"columns":{"min":{},"max":[10]},"rows":{"min":[10],"max":[10]},"pages":{}}}
  </script>
</div>



```r
1:10 %>% {c(min(.), max(.))}
```

```
## [1]  1 10
```


## 当mutate遇到map

当`dplyr::mutate`遇到`purrr::map`，情况就复杂很多了。然而，这种情况，tidyverse比比皆是。我就多说几句吧


```r
iris %>% 
  head(3) %>% 
  mutate(., r_sum = pmap_dbl(select_if(., is.numeric), sum)) 
```

<div data-pagedtable="false">
  <script data-pagedtable-source type="application/json">
{"columns":[{"label":["Sepal.Length"],"name":[1],"type":["dbl"],"align":["right"]},{"label":["Sepal.Width"],"name":[2],"type":["dbl"],"align":["right"]},{"label":["Petal.Length"],"name":[3],"type":["dbl"],"align":["right"]},{"label":["Petal.Width"],"name":[4],"type":["dbl"],"align":["right"]},{"label":["Species"],"name":[5],"type":["fctr"],"align":["left"]},{"label":["r_sum"],"name":[6],"type":["dbl"],"align":["right"]}],"data":[{"1":"5.1","2":"3.5","3":"1.4","4":"0.2","5":"setosa","6":"10.2"},{"1":"4.9","2":"3.0","3":"1.4","4":"0.2","5":"setosa","6":"9.5"},{"1":"4.7","2":"3.2","3":"1.3","4":"0.2","5":"setosa","6":"9.4"}],"options":{"columns":{"min":{},"max":[10]},"rows":{"min":[10],"max":[10]},"pages":{}}}
  </script>
</div>

这里`mutate()`行，有两个`.`, 实际这两个`.`都是等待`iris %>% head(3)`传来的data.frame




```r
df <- tibble(
  mean = c(1, 2),
  sd = c(2, 4)
)
df
```

<div data-pagedtable="false">
  <script data-pagedtable-source type="application/json">
{"columns":[{"label":["mean"],"name":[1],"type":["dbl"],"align":["right"]},{"label":["sd"],"name":[2],"type":["dbl"],"align":["right"]}],"data":[{"1":"1","2":"2"},{"1":"2","2":"4"}],"options":{"columns":{"min":{},"max":[10]},"rows":{"min":[10],"max":[10]},"pages":{}}}
  </script>
</div>

```r
df %>%
  mutate(., rand  = map(mean, ~ rnorm(5, .))) %>% 
  unnest_wider(rand)
```

<div data-pagedtable="false">
  <script data-pagedtable-source type="application/json">
{"columns":[{"label":["mean"],"name":[1],"type":["dbl"],"align":["right"]},{"label":["sd"],"name":[2],"type":["dbl"],"align":["right"]},{"label":["...1"],"name":[3],"type":["dbl"],"align":["right"]},{"label":["...2"],"name":[4],"type":["dbl"],"align":["right"]},{"label":["...3"],"name":[5],"type":["dbl"],"align":["right"]},{"label":["...4"],"name":[6],"type":["dbl"],"align":["right"]},{"label":["...5"],"name":[7],"type":["dbl"],"align":["right"]}],"data":[{"1":"1","2":"2","3":"-0.1499","4":"0.5936","5":"0.3951","6":"0.5752","7":"1.5439"},{"1":"2","2":"4","3":"1.3979","4":"1.3645","5":"2.8053","6":"2.9429","7":"0.3435"}],"options":{"columns":{"min":{},"max":[10]},"rows":{"min":[10],"max":[10]},"pages":{}}}
  </script>
</div>


- 第一个 `.`， 是`df`
- 第二个 `.`， 是`df`中的`mean`




```r
df %>%
  mutate(rand = map2(mean, sd, ~ rnorm(5, .x, .y))) %>% 
  unnest_wider(rand)
```

<div data-pagedtable="false">
  <script data-pagedtable-source type="application/json">
{"columns":[{"label":["mean"],"name":[1],"type":["dbl"],"align":["right"]},{"label":["sd"],"name":[2],"type":["dbl"],"align":["right"]},{"label":["...1"],"name":[3],"type":["dbl"],"align":["right"]},{"label":["...2"],"name":[4],"type":["dbl"],"align":["right"]},{"label":["...3"],"name":[5],"type":["dbl"],"align":["right"]},{"label":["...4"],"name":[6],"type":["dbl"],"align":["right"]},{"label":["...5"],"name":[7],"type":["dbl"],"align":["right"]}],"data":[{"1":"1","2":"2","3":"3.5620","4":"2.121","5":"-0.0961","6":"0.5866","7":"3.0198"},{"1":"2","2":"4","3":"-0.5676","4":"8.061","5":"-2.4779","6":"9.9209","7":"0.7133"}],"options":{"columns":{"min":{},"max":[10]},"rows":{"min":[10],"max":[10]},"pages":{}}}
  </script>
</div>

- `mean`传给 `.x`
- `sd`传给 `.y`



再来一个变态的。（我们不一定要这样写，但我们尽可能的要明白它的意思。）


```r
df <- tribble(
  ~ a, ~b,
  1, 10,
  2, 11
)


df %>%
   mutate(., sum = purrr::pmap_dbl(., ~sum(...)))
```

<div data-pagedtable="false">
  <script data-pagedtable-source type="application/json">
{"columns":[{"label":["a"],"name":[1],"type":["dbl"],"align":["right"]},{"label":["b"],"name":[2],"type":["dbl"],"align":["right"]},{"label":["sum"],"name":[3],"type":["dbl"],"align":["right"]}],"data":[{"1":"1","2":"10","3":"11"},{"1":"2","2":"11","3":"13"}],"options":{"columns":{"min":{},"max":[10]},"rows":{"min":[10],"max":[10]},"pages":{}}}
  </script>
</div>





## Dot dot dot

```r
commas <- function(...) 
  stringr::str_c(..., collapse = ", ")


commas(letters[1:10])
```

```
## [1] "a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, i, j"
```



## Don't confuse 

<!-- Don't confuse with many function arguments that are prefixed with a . -->
注意：有些函数的参数前缀是 .


```r
mutate_all(.tbl, .funs, ...)

mutate_if(.tbl, .predicate, .funs, ...)

mutate_at(.tbl, .vars, .funs, ..., .cols = NULL)

select_all(.tbl, .funs = list(), ...)

rename_all(.tbl, .funs = list(), ...)
```



## 小结

* tidyvere中
  + 占位符(时常经常和 `%>%` 一起)
  + Lambda函数
  + 一元函数（LHS）
 
* 其他情形
  + 回归公式
  + 正则表达式
 
* 注意
  + 有些函数参数以 . 前缀(不要混淆喔! )
 
 
 

## 回答问题

现在回答本章开始的问题


```r
read_csv("./demo_data/wages.csv") %>%
  mutate(letter = str_extract(race, "(?<=h)(.)")) %>%
  select(., -letter) %>%
  mutate_at(vars(race), ~ as.factor(.)) %>%
  mutate_at(vars(sex), ~ if_else(. == "male", 1, 0)) %>%
  filter_if(~ is.numeric(.), all_vars(. != 0)) %>% 
  split(.$sex) %>%
  map(~ lm(earn ~ ., data = .)) %>%
  map_dfr(., ~ broom::tidy(.), .id = "sex")
```

- 第1行：路径中`.`代表当前位置，如果是`..`表示上一级目录
- 第2行：正则表达式，代表任何字符
- 第3行：占位符，等待数据框的传入，也可以简写`select(-letter)`
- 第4行: lambda函数，`~ as.factor(.)`也可以简写`as.factor`，`~`和`(.)`要么都写，要么都不写
- 第5行：同上,lambda函数
- 第6行：第一个`.`代表lambda函数; 第二个`.`也是lambda函数，但这里它是`all_vars(expr)`中expr的一种特有写法，代表所有数值型变量，***行方向构成的向量**, `all_vars(. != 0)`函数返回TRUE或FALSE，从而帮助`filter()`是否筛选该行
- 第7行：占位符，代表上面传来的数据框
- 第8行：回归模型`lm`中，第一个`.`代表除**因变量**earn之外所有的变量，第二个`.`占位符，留给上面的数据框
- 第9行：第一个`.`是占位符，代表上面传来的list，第二个`.`lambda函数，依次对list的元素迭代处理，第二个`.`是参数名，`.id`是特有的一个符号。
